# Why You Should Set Goals

The first step in your job search should be to set goals for what you want to achieve. This is because **goals affect behavioural change**.

They encourage you to take action, they keep  
you focused, and they hold you accountable. They’re a way of challenging  
and pushing yourself to reach further, and can be very powerful when  
used in the right way.

It’s worth digging a little deeper into this  
process, rather than simply thinking ‘I want to get hired as a  
compositor’ and leaving it at that.

Let’s dive in.

# What’s Your Vision For The Future

Setting realistic and productive goals starts  
with imagining your life ahead. What's your vision for the future? What  
do you want your life to look like two years, five years, or ten years  
from now?

Visualising your ideal future and figuring out what you _truly_ want is sometimes half the battle. You have to **be completely honest with yourself**, and carefully consider what you want to **plan and commit to achieve**.

Think about **what inspires you**,  
and what your values are. Your goals should feel meaningful to you,  
otherwise your motivation to follow through is likely to wane. Visualise  
the bigger picture first, and get perspective on **what’s important in your life**.

💡 If you get stuck, follow your curiosity. It’s usually a great indicator for what you should be looking into.

Your goals should give you a clear **sense of direction**, represent **something to aspire to**, and help **define your purpose**.  
Setting goals puts you in the driver’s seat of your existence because  
you actively acknowledge what you want out of life and start to take  
control of your future.

– So, it's time to brainstorm:

- What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?

- What does a happy life and success look like to _you_?

# What’s In Your Control

Focus on setting goals for things that are  
within your control. Ideally, your goals should not depend on anything  
or anyone but you. What can you **directly be responsible for**?

If one of your goals is to work on a Marvel  
movie, that outcome is not necessarily up to you. Circumstances outside  
of your control may lead you to work on other projects.

Instead, a more useful goal would be to improve your skills to reach a standard high enough to be _able_ to work on a Marvel movie.

Now _that's_  
a goal which you can break down and analyse, create objectives for, and  
work your way towards. And, if the opportunity arises to work on a  
Marvel movie later on, you will be ready. Even if it doesn't, you'll  
still be able to create VFX of the same calibre.

'Working on a Marvel movie' should be the **byproduct** of your goal, not the goal itself. However, it should still help inform your decisions about what to do going forward.

# What's The Path Forward

Plan out how you can get from where you are to where you want to be.

For example, if you are currently working in  
the advertising industry, and plan on continuing to do so, that's  
unlikely to be the path that will lead you to working on a Marvel movie.

At some point you will have to change course  
and move over to the motion pictures industry where you can get  
experience working on movies. That might feel like a big step and so  
let's break it down – How can you get there?

A stepping stone may be to work on TV shows.  
The VFX in Netflix projects have reached a very high level now, and  
getting experience working on some of them would help bridge the gap  
between advertising and motion pictures.

Remember, what you want should be the  
byproduct of your goals, and so if you want to work on Netflix projects  
you should aim to reach a skill level high enough to qualify you as a  
candidate.

Work on improving your keying skills,  
practise CG integration, learn how to properly do projection work,  
develop your eye for detail, and so on. Break your overall goals down  
into smaller subgoals, each with its own objectives.

Ask yourself: What's the smallest step I can  
take? And then get going. Consistently make efforts to work your way  
through your plan. Many small steps will take you far. And any step is  
better than none.

For example, my website and all the posts on  
it are a sum of many small steps I have taken in researching,  
developing, organising, writing and rewriting (hopefully) useful  
information. On some days I write for hours, on other days only for 15  
minutes. But I try my best to **continually make progress**.

You may have a similar experience when progressing toward your goals. Just keep in mind that consistency is the key.

# Set S.M.A.R.T. Goals

To help with setting goals, you can use the **S.M.A.R.T.** system:

- **Specific**. Vague goals won’t help you set anything into action. You should have  
    clear and established aims. Who, what, where, when, which, why, and how? If your goals are too broad and undefined they can feel overwhelming  
    and difficult to achieve. Break them down into subgoals and objectives,  
    and be specific.
    
    'Improve keying skills' is too broad of a goal –  
    it has to be broken down into actionable steps. 'Practise IBK keying on  
    uneven green screens', 'Restore hair detail using [multiplication keying](https://www.keheka.com/multiply-key-technique-for-extracting-fine-detail/)', 'Learn to build [edge mattes](https://www.keheka.com/perimeter-advanced-edge-mattes/) for despilling', etc. are more helpful goals, and can be specified even further, still:
    
    'Practise  
    the IBK stacking and IBK dilate techniques on poorly lit green screens  
    with dynamic lighting changes, where the foreground subject is out of  
    focus'. That's a pretty solid _What_ part of the objective.
    

- **Measurable**. Your goals should be measurable in some sense. If not by numbers or  
    statistics, at least by some metric or milestone that will help you keep track of how far you’ve come, and how close you are to reaching your  
    goal.
    
    For example, 'By Friday next week, complete tutorials XYZ  
    about lens distortion and understand how to use it correctly when  
    compositing CG renders'.
    

- **Attainable**. Your goals can definitely be ambitious, but they should also be within  
    reach. If you are a roto/prep artist and plan on becoming a VFX  
    supervisor on a Marvel movie within six months, that’s just not  
    plausible. Make sure to do your research and be realistic about what you want to achieve.
    
    Going from being a roto/prep artist to becoming  
    a junior compositor in six months – as a small step toward becoming a  
    VFX supervisor – _that_ is  
    certainly a much more attainable goal. You want to set yourself up for  
    success, not place impossible expectations on yourself.
    
    You _do_  
    want to push your comfort zone a bit, though. When a goal is difficult,  
    but not impossible, you may find that you will work harder to achieve  
    it.
    

- **Relevant**. Are your goals and objectives contributing to the bigger picture? Going off and learning how to do water simulations in Houdini is great, but  
    it probably won’t do as much for your compositing career as studying  
    keying techniques in Nuke.
    
    It’s quite simple; if you want to  
    become a great compositor, pay particular attention to mastering skills  
    relevant to compositing. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a  
    focus.
    

- **Time-bound**. Set realistic timeframes for your goals. If they’re too short, then  
    complex and time-consuming tasks won’t be done on time which will just  
    lead to frustration. And if you set too generous deadlines for simple  
    goals, you’ll squander your potential and feel unproductive.
    
    It  
    will take time to find the sweet spot, but keep adjusting as you go and  
    you will get there. And when you do, you’ll find that having a realistic  
    deadline pushes you to work harder and to stay focused.
    

As you can tell, it takes a lot of research  
to set specific, actionable goals. Just remember, the time you spend is  
purely an investment in yourself. If you commit to it, it _will_ help give you clarity in life.

# Combat 'Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind'

**Write down your goals**. Using the tips above, have an honest brainstorm session and put down on paper everything that you really want to achieve.

Afterwards, **organise all your notes**.  
Order your goals, subgoals, and objectives by priority. Colour code  
them if you like, make a list, or create a collage. Make it visual – in  
any manner that helps _you_.

That way, your goals don't just stay in your  
head as thoughts and dreams, but become more tangible and real. And  
whether they take the shape of simple written notes, a vision board, or a  
colourful action plan, **keep your goals somewhere visible**.

Somewhere you visit every day, like on the  
refrigerator. They will serve as a daily, visual reminder of what you  
want to achieve in life, and nudge you to work towards it. Not to  
mention, they will proudly display your progress which can be a real  
motivational boost.

As an example, I have a physical calendar on  
my refrigerator. In addition to the daily agenda column I have columns  
for working out and for writing posts for my website. I bought a bunch  
of cheap star stickers, and every time I do a workout or publish an  
article I stick a star on that day, in the relevant column.

It's just a simple, visual way to track  
progress and help motivate me. But it's so effective. Feel free to  
experiment with different things, something else might work better for  
you, specifically.

# Revisit Your Goals Regularly

Life does not typically follow a linear path,  
and neither do your goals and objectives. They are likely to change and  
evolve over time, and so you should regularly re-evaluate them. **Every three to six months** is a good rule of thumb.

💡 Set a recurring reminder in your calendar to check in on your goals.

For each goal, ask yourself:

- Is this goal still **important** to me? Will achieving this goal still bring (enough) value to my life?  
    Pursuing a goal may mean sacrificing in other areas of your life, and  
    you might find that some goals are not worth it.

- Is this goal still **relevant** to my career path? New information may have come to light which has  
    rendered the goal obsolete. A tool or technique you wanted to learn may  
    have been superseded since the last time you set your goals. Or, you may have fallen in love with digital matte painting or another discipline  
    on your journey, and have decided to pursue that instead.

- Is there a better goal which should **replace** it? Identify the rewards and consequences, and consider changing the goal to optimise your path forward.

- Are there any (new) **obstacles** in my path towards this goal? If so, make a plan for how to overcome or circumvent them.

- Are there any **new goals or objectives** I should add? You may have discovered new things and learned a lot  
    since the last time you checked in. Goals also tend to become more  
    specific the further along your career path you are. Update or add goals and objectives as needed.

And, as an overarching question, ask yourself:

- Am I heading in the **right direction**? Should I course-correct? Reflect on your progress so far and on where  
    you are currently heading, and assess if that is still in line with what you want.

Just by asking yourself the few questions above, you should get a good idea of which goals you need to **reinforce, readjust, reprioritise, or remove**.

# Celebrate Victories

Lastly, don’t forget to give yourself a well  
deserved pat on the back and celebrate when you finish your objectives  
and reach your goals. You are actively taking steps to improve your  
life. That’s a powerful thing.

# Why You Should Network

Before you even start applying for a role, it’s a very good idea (I would even go so far as to say it's a _must_)  
to work on expanding your professional network. You should start making  
connections in the VFX industry while you are still in university or  
while you are still employed at your current company – for the same  
reason you don’t wait to plant a crop until you’re hungry.

Investing time in networking before searching  
for a job will often pay dividends. Someone you connect with today  
could be the person who leads you to a job offer a few months or years  
down the line. And vice versa, you may be able to help refer someone _you_ know for a role. **Networking is mutually beneficial**. If you become someone who others can turn to for help, you'll find that they will often return the favour.

# LinkedIn

There are a few ways to go about networking. The easiest way is on LinkedIn. In the search bar at the top of the page, type in **recruiter**, **talent acquisition**, **hr**, or similar search phrases, and then click on People.

Connect with all the VFX recruiters you can  
find, even those hiring for companies you don't necessarily want to work  
for. Just as you are likely to move around companies, recruiters move  
around, too. Later on, they might be hiring for a great company that you  
_are_ interested in. And then you will already be connected, and will see their recruitment post or get a private message from them.

💡 Make sure your LinkedIn profile is professional and up to date. Have a look at [Part 4: Write An Impressive CV](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-4-write-an-impressive-cv/) of this guide for tips. Choosing the correct industry in the _Intro_ part of your profile should also help narrow your search results down to the most relevant. I have mine set to _Motion Pictures & Film_.

Recruiters are usually keen on connecting  
with you, and so it’s often enough to just hit the Connect button next  
to their name. Though, it doesn’t hurt at all to personalise your  
invitation with a **short and friendly message**.

I wouldn’t phrase the message in the  
invitation as a question they’d have to answer directly, however. People  
can have a tendency to delay or outright avoid accepting the invitation  
if they don’t have an answer there and then. Make it as easy as  
possible for them to connect with you.

You could write something simple such as:

_Hey [FirstNameOfRecruiter],_  
  
_I saw that you are recruiting compositors for [CompanyName] and I_  
_thought it would be great to connect with you to stay up to date with_  
_your job openings._  
  
_Thanks,_  
_[YourFirstName]_

Obviously make it your own, but write something short that is non-demanding, non-urgent, and just **easy to say yes to**.

There are hundreds of recruiters out there  
posting VFX jobs on LinkedIn. Try to connect with a significant portion  
of them. You can also search for the Head of Compositing or Head of 2D  
at a VFX company you want to work for, or someone with a similar role  
who is involved in hiring, and connect with them to get on their radar.

Build up a large network and you’ll start seeing more and more opportunities come your way.

# Other Recruitment Sites

LinkedIn is the biggest platform out there but there are other websites you can check out as well, such as [Zerply](https://zerply.com/), [Google Jobs](https://www.google.com/search?q=compositor+recruitment&ibp=htl;jobs&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiN1uSS4Jz7AhUSEcAKHVPIDMoQutcGKAF6BAgVEAY#htivrt=jobs&htidocid=OOplaoFMYlwAAAAAAAAAAA%3D%3D&fpstate=tldetail) (search for _compositor recruitment_ and click on _Jobs_ to get to this page), [Total Jobs](https://www.totaljobs.com/jobs/compositor?searchOrigin=Resultlist_top-search), or [Indeed](https://uk.indeed.com/jobs?q=compositor). For a list of several VFX companies and their careers pages, have a look at [UK Screen Alliance](https://www.ukscreenalliance.co.uk/subpages/job-vacancies/).

Use these websites to connect with  
recruiters, discover job openings, research what companies are looking  
for, and find out what the rates are in your area.

💡 Speaking of rates, [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/)  
is another useful website for researching that, as well as looking into  
each company’s culture and reputation. (As always, take what you read  
with a grain of salt and look at overall trends for guidance).

The websites above are UK-focused and so if  
you are in a different country please search for similar VFX recruitment  
sites local to you.

# Events

Another great way of networking is to attend **industry events** such as [FMX](https://fmx.de/) or [SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/).  
There, you can engage with VFX business professionals in a setting  
where people welcome new connections. Look up which events are happening  
near you and if you can, attend them.

Similarly, if your school or university throws a **showcase event** or organises a **VFX company visit**, go ahead and attend those. Or, you may find there are **social events** being held near you, such as the [Bring Your Own Animation](https://london.siggraph.org/event/byoa-bring-animation/) in London. There may even be an [online webinar](https://www.foundry.com/events) coming up which you can attend.

💡 Dress smart at these events. Give firm handshakes – this is such an old piece of advice, and yet people _still_  
don't do it. You’ll physically make people feel they are in safe hands  
if you do. Use an open and friendly body language so that others feel  
comfortable approaching you. Simply smiling and being positive will  
attract people.

**Do your homework**.  
Check to see if companies you are interested in will attend the event  
you're going to (they often post on social media if they are), and find  
out who is going. Look them up, research the company, and you will have  
more **thoughtful questions** to ask when you meet.

Make sure to bring along your showreel and  
CV. A laptop or tablet is great for playing your showreel to recruiters.  
It’s all about being prepared and making it **as easy as possible** for them to look at your work.

It’s natural to gravitate towards people that you already know at such events, but networking is also about **meeting people outside of your circle**.  
If you’re a bit shy, try to consciously push the boundaries of your  
comfort zone. Introducing yourself and striking up a friendly  
conversation, or extending an invitation for someone to join a  
conversation you’re already part of will go a long way.

Networking is a long term pursuit, and so **attend events regularly**  
if you can, and follow up with the people you talk to. It’s about  
building relationships and trust – which usually doesn’t happen  
overnight.

At the events, **avoid standing in the doorway**.  
Give people some time and space to breathe as they enter and let them  
go to the bar and get a drink first. A good place to stand is near the  
bar area so you meet people after they’ve got a drink in hand and are  
ready to mingle.

**Standing in line**  
is also a great opportunity to chat with people. It can be a  
springboard for a productive conversation. And should the conversation  
happen to stagnate, there is a natural point to break it off once you  
get your drink or snacks. Avoid staying and hovering around the buffet  
if there is one, though. Let people get their food, and rather meet them  
near the tables or out on the floor.

**Break the ice**.  
The person you want to talk to may (also) be nervous and will  
appreciate you approaching them. Remember, everyone is usually friendly  
but you have to go first. It might feel awkward to begin with, or  
sometimes you might feel rejected, but that is part of the learning  
curve. It gets better with practice. It can be helpful to bring a  
wing(wo)man and/or prepare icebreaker questions beforehand.

Prepare a **short and compelling description**  
of yourself and your background, and be ready for when people ask you  
about it. It doesn’t need to be a super rehearsed, slick story, but it’s  
good to think of some talking points. Unprepared people will often  
ramble on, or give a staggered response with lots of umms and ahhs,  
trying to get to an interesting point. That will lose the other person’s  
interest quickly.

**Be authentic**.  
Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not and take on a different  
personality. Just be yourself – the best version of you. If you’re  
naturally introverted or a bit shy, just listen more than you speak. As  
long as you are interested and ask thoughtful questions, people will  
still feel they had a great conversation with you.

Try to **remember people’s names**.  
Most people don’t and so if you do, you’ll stand out. A good trick is  
to connect their name with one of their unique physical features or  
traits. If someone is called Esmeralda and she has distinct, bright  
green eyes, you could for example link _emerald eyes_ with Esmeralda to remember her name.

You can also write their name down on your phone after meeting them, along with a couple of notes about the conversation. **Don’t stay on your phone** for too long, though! It closes you off to people who might want to approach you.

**It’s not only about you**.  
Listen to other people and what they are looking for. Actively ask them  
questions and genuinely show interest in them. Paraphrase them to show  
that you understand what they are saying. Networking is a two way  
street. You may be able to help them as well. And you’ll find that you  
can learn a lot by just listening. Each person you meet is a vault  
containing a wealth of insight, knowledge and experience. And  
interestingly, the more interested you are the more interesting you  
become.

Avoid only approaching people that you perceive to be directly useful to you. Try to **meet with a diverse group of people**.  
They may expand your ideas, and you may really enjoy spending time with  
them. You’ll avoid getting stuck in an echo chamber, and will build  
more interesting and pleasant relationships.

**Be a good guest**.  
Behave (don’t get drunk), avoid sitting in a corner by yourself, and  
make an effort to reach out to people. Take advantage of the great  
opportunities to connect that you have right in front of you.

After the event, connect on LinkedIn with the people you met and follow up with them. I would do it **within 24 hours**  
so their memory of you is still fresh. Send them a thank you message if  
they gave you advice, or invite them to continue the conversation. At  
events you might not get the time to delve too deeply into a subject, as  
everyone moves around and speaks with multiple people throughout the  
day or evening.

**Proactively share information**  
that you think would be useful to others. If you know of a role someone  
might be looking for, or a tool or tutorial for a technique you  
discussed with them, share it. It’s a great way to get in touch with  
people, and to provide value to their lives.

# At Work

Building relationships with people you already work with can help you **grow in your current role** or help you **step into the next one**. You might even find a mentor, or become a mentor for someone else.

Networking doesn’t always have to be about  
expanding outside of your current work situation, there is often value  
to find within. And since you and your fellow employees are in the same  
boat, it’s **easy and natural to connect**.

Keep in mind, pretty much everything covered  
in the Events section applies to work as well, though it will be less  
formal. You are essentially making friends and helping each other out.

Speaking of events again, really make efforts to **attend social work events**.  
It’s a fantastic way of getting to know the people you work with and  
strengthening your relationships. I’m still really good friends with a  
group of people I worked with seven years ago, and we all still chat  
pretty much daily in our Whatsapp group, even though most of us are at  
different companies now.

# Small Freelance Jobs

If you are just starting out, you can also  
network by searching for small freelance jobs online and offering your  
services. These **mutually low risk jobs** can be a great way to get your foot in the door, and can lead to more work later on.

💡 Clients are often more open to hiring recent graduates for these projects.

As an example, early on in my career I  
applied to work remotely for a Dutch company on a small project which  
then led me to working on _six_ freelance projects in total for the same company.

The pay might be a little low to start off with but it **gets the flywheel going**.  
I would not advise you to work for free, though, unless you are starved  
for showreel material and the project is small and won’t take too much  
of your time.

# Courses

Whether it’s at university or via a short  
training course, meeting like minded people with a common interest in  
VFX is a wonderful thing. In a natural setting like this you can learn a  
lot from each other. Help each other to progress and to understand  
different subjects and techniques. You’ll have similar goals and a lot  
of common ground. Take advantage of that and **build each other up**.

You may end up working together with some of  
your classmates later on. How great would it be if you were already good  
friends and could support each other?

Keep in touch with your teachers, too. If you  
made the effort to do well in their course, they may recommend you for a  
role. One of my teachers ended up getting me two different freelance  
jobs after I finished university.

And again, pretty much everything covered in  
the Events section applies to courses as well, although it will be much  
less formal, even less than at work.

# Friends

If you have friends in a VFX company or know someone related to it in some way, there is no shame in asking them for help with **providing a recommendation**.  
Many companies have an internal referral system which can help  
highlight you as a candidate and fast track you to an interview.

The VFX industry is a small world and you  
will likely run into the same people several times throughout your  
career. Being a nice person and building a reputation for being a great  
compositor will get you far.

# Why You Should Level Up Your Showreel

**Your showreel is your main weapon**  
in the competition for getting hired as a compositor. No matter how  
impressive your CV might be, if your showreel is terrible and displays  
poor skill then that overrides everything. The decision will be made to  
not hire you.

The opposite is also true: if your showreel  
is outstanding but your CV is not, that is much easier to forgive. You  
will definitely be scrutinised more during the interview to ensure you  
actually did the work that’s shown in your reel – but if you did, there  
is a good chance you will get the job.

So you should absolutely focus on making your  
showreel as spectacular as you possibly can. Whet your blade until its  
edge is razor sharp.

# Showreel Goals

The way you structure your showreel is important. You have five main goals, which are:

1. **Immediately grab the attention of the viewer**. That means starting out with your most impressive work. Hook them in with spectacular shots.

1. **Hold on to their attention throughout the showreel**. Continue with great and interesting shots that display your mastery of  
    the ‘bread and butter’ compositing skills, like keying, CG integration,  
    projections, etc. Let them know that you know your stuff.

1. **Finish strong**. End your showreel on a high note, i.e. with a striking shot. If you end on a boring, unimpressive shot it detracts from the overall impression. It’s like eating an amazing meal, and then having a dessert that tastes bad. Sure, the meal was great, but you might not be leaving the  
    restaurant feeling as satisfied as you’d want to. Make sure that your  
    dessert is tasty.

1. **Leave them wanting more**. Keep the showreel brief and avoid oversaturating the viewer with shots  
    that drag on and on. Your showreel is a teaser trailer for your skills  
    as a compositor. The viewer should be left with the feeling of: _That was amazing, I want to see more_.

1. **Make sure they know how to contact you**. Add a short information screen at the start of your showreel containing your details. And then again at the end. You want to reduce any  
    friction there may be for the recruiter to contact you.

Let’s look into how you can achieve all of the goals above.

# Runtime

Your showreel should not be any longer than  
two minutes in total. That’s roughly the maximum attention span you can  
expect a showreel to attract today. I would actually aim for about **1 minute and 30 seconds all in all** – and that's _only_ if you have enough great material to use.

That means you have to be brutal when cutting  
the shots. Only the best of the best should make it into your showreel.  
Get a second opinion from another compositor, and a third from yet  
another, if you can.

Absolutely **do NOT pad your showreel**  
with mediocre shots. Many people do this to make their reel longer and  
try to show more work experience. Avoid doing this. The vast majority of  
recruiters would _much_ rather watch 30 seconds of greatness than 90 seconds of mediocrity.

# Intro/Outro

There is no need for a lengthy, flashy,  
animated intro and/or outro in your showreel. Simply add a 3-5 seconds  
long, easily readable information screen at the start, and then again at  
the end, containing:

- Your name

- Your (specific) title

- Your email address

- Your phone number (optional)

💡 Make sure to spell check your name and contact details. If you are  
uncomfortable adding your contact details to your showreel (for instance  
if it’s a public one), you can password protect it. More on that later.

Don't get me wrong, you can absolutely design the information screen to **look sleek**,  
but having a twenty second visual effect revealing the word Showreel  
and your name, before dissolving into a cloud of smoke is not just  
unnecessary; it is frankly a waste of time.

There is no need to write 'Thank you for  
watching' at the end of your showreel. However polite it may be, it  
comes across as amateurish. Instead, end your showreel with the  
information screen as described above, making it as easy as possible for  
the recruiter to contact you.

# Shot Selections

Your showreel should be snappy, because you  
want to keep the viewer’s attention all the way through. Think of it as a  
commercial for your skills. It should be energetic and interesting.  
Avoid including shots that are longer than about **four to five seconds**, unless they are extremely detailed and amazing.

💡 Often, you only need a small section of a long shot (i.e. just the  
beginning, the middle portion, or the end part) to give a great  
impression, and can safely cut the rest of the shot out. Remember, the  
longer you hold on a shot, the **more room for scrutiny** you allow the viewer. You want them to look at the shot, be impressed, and then move on to the next one.

It's worth mentioning again: Only include **your very best work**,  
and be painfully honest with yourself about this. Padding your showreel  
with mediocre shots kills any momentum you've built up for the  
recruiter toward hiring you. Remember, you'll be judged by your worst  
work. The shot you worked the longest or hardest on might not be your  
best shot. Sometimes you have to kill your darlings.

Curate your showreel shots for **the role that you are applying for**.  
If you are making a compositing showreel, the recruiter will not be  
interested in seeing model breakdowns, animation or lighting work. Those  
would be more relevant for a generalist role. When applying for a  
compositing role, including all those other disciplines actually _detracts_ from your overall impression as a compositor because you are showing less of what the recruiter is looking for.

Include a **variation of different shots from different shows**.  
Avoid having several very similar looking shots from the same sequence  
one after the other. Especially, if they all show the same type of skill  
or technique being used. It gets a bit dull for the viewer.

Ideally, only include shots where **you did all, or the majority, of the compositing work**.  
If you only did part of the compositing work on a shot, you should be  
ultra-transparent about this. Never try to pass off other people's work  
as your own. Keep in mind, lying by omission is still lying.

Show **specific skills and techniques related to the role**.  
For a compositor, shots with CG integration, keying work, projections,  
etc. are very useful to show off on your reel. You want the recruiter to  
tick boxes and see that you would be a good fit skillswise for the team  
and the project.

For juniors, it’s okay to follow a cool tutorial and use a shot you made with it in your showreel – but **don't just copy everything**  
they did in the tutorial. Do something new with it; show that you  
learned the idea behind the technique and are able to apply it to  
something else.

Only include shots that you are comfortable with and would be **happy to work on in the future**.  
If you dislike gore, for example, don’t include a blood splatter shot  
in your showreel. A recruiter may see that shot, relate it to the  
project they are hiring for, and pick you out based on that. And then  
you’d be working on gore shots for months on end. Note: it’s not a  
bulletproof way of avoiding types of work you don’t like, but it may  
filter out some of it.

💡 If you include any shots with a static camera in between shots with moving cameras, consider adding a small pan or zoom to **make the still shots more dynamic** and flow better within your showreel.

# Shot Descriptions

Often, several compositors will work on the  
same shot, each contributing different things. It’s important to let the  
viewer know **exactly what you have contributed** to each shot in your showreel, so that they can properly assess your skill level.

To do this, you can **write a short description**  
of your contribution to each shot as an insert at the bottom of the  
frame in your showreel. Be specific, but concise. If you only added the  
background building signs, and not the gigantic foreground robot, be _very_ clear about this. Never lie, or lie by omission, about what you have contributed to a shot.

💡 Even if you did all of the compositing work on a shot, still add a description to clarify that you did.

If you add clear descriptions in your showreel, there is **no need to make a separate shot description document**  
listing all the shots with thumbnails and explaining what you have  
contributed to them. Your shots will be discussed in the interview as  
well, and you will have further opportunity to go into detail about your  
work.

💡 Make sure to spell check any text in your showreel.

# Shot Breakdowns

It is okay to include a few compositing breakdowns in your showreel, but **limit the amount**  
and mainly show final work. Perhaps a maximum of a 70/30 split between  
composites and breakdowns – if you do decide to include them.

It is enough to **show just the befores and afters**  
in the breakdowns. For instance, the blue screen plate with the  
foreground character first, and then the final comp with the replaced  
background. There is no need for wiping through numerous passes in  
between, and showing every step of the composite.

💡 A junior mistake is to show too many steps. Recruiters don't need  
to see the before and after where you added lens distortion, a vignette,  
or grain. Keep it simple and just show the scan, and then the final  
composite. (Unless you have very significant and interesting steps in  
between).

Also, if you _do_ add breakdowns, **avoid including them for very simple shots**. A breakdown should show a significant change from before to after, to warrant its existence.

# Music

George Lucas famously said that “sound is  
half the experience” in the context of watching movies. I agree with  
that statement, however the reality is that **showreels will often be watched on mute**.

Look at it from the recruiter’s perspective –  
intently watching numerous showreels every day gets tiring, especially  
if the audio is jarring. Remember, the music that you really like might  
sound awful to someone else’s ears.

I don’t think that should stop you from  
adding music to your showreel, however. It just means there are certain  
things you should take into consideration when doing so:

- Avoid super niche and odd (to the general public) music. Any music you add should be **easy to like**.

- Look for instrumentals, or songs **without too many lyrics** to distract from the visuals.

- **Get permission** to use the music you pick - especially if your showreel is public and  
    not password protected. You can search for royalty free music online.

- **Don't prolong or shorten a shot** significantly because you're trying to match it to a song. Cut your  
    shots to show your best work. Adding only a couple of extra seconds to  
    an already long shot can really make it feel like it drags on.

- Pick music that **matches the energy of your showreel**. Large, sweeping environments may fit different music than fast-paced gun fights.

# Confidentiality

There is a high level of trust involved in  
the visual effects industry. Leaking content before it gets released is  
one of the greatest sins. You may get sued for breach of contract/NDA,  
as well as face immediate termination of employment. Your name will be  
tarnished within the industry and it will be difficult to find work  
again. Don’t make this mistake.

Instead, show that you are a trustworthy person:

- Never put pre-release content in your showreel.

- Get permission first for the shots you _do_ put in your showreel.

- Put your showreel on a site like for example [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) where you can password protect it.

# Permissions

The last few years has seen a shift into a much, _much_  
stricter regime when it comes to getting permission to use material for  
showreels. Especially if there is talent (actors/actresses) present in  
the shot. Their contracts have become exceedingly strict about how they  
are portrayed publicly, and which images they allow to be used.

And so, VFX studios have to seek explicit  
permission from the client, who has to seek explicit permission from the  
production company, before any showreel shots are released.

That means, on some shows you will  
unfortunately not get permission to use the shots you have worked on for  
your showreel. It can be a huge letdown but that is regrettably how it  
is for the time being.

Some artists wait until the Blu-ray is  
released and rip clips of the shots that they worked on for their  
showreel. Be very careful with this – it is not recommended and can have  
legal repercussions. Especially, if your showreel is not password  
protected and is available to the public.

The good news is that recruiters are aware of  
the showreel material shortage. You may just have to explain your  
experience in more detail during the interview instead.

# Showreel Specifications

Although a lot of shows are delivered in 4K  
these days, rendering your showreel at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 is  
still pretty standard. If you have 4K shots, though, feel free to upload  
in 4K.

For the best video quality, please follow [Vimeo’s guidelines](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056550451-Video-and-audio-compression-guidelines) for video and audio compression.

# Why You Should Level Up Your CV

Today, recruiters will typically look you up on LinkedIn, however there is still value in making a sleek, curated CV to **show off the best version of yourself**. Especially for when you are the first person to reach out.

[![](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/KEHEKA_CV_Kenn_Hedin_Kalvik_2022-1.png)](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/KEHEKA_CV_Kenn_Hedin_Kalvik_2022-1.png)

Example: My own CV (with certain information changed for privacy/confidentiality).

# Design

While the _content_ of your CV is the most important part, _how_  
you present it to the recruiter is a very close second. Just a single,  
hard to read block of text with no punctuation will give a bad first  
impression.

You don't need to hire a professional to design your CV. Though, spending a bit of time to create a **sleek and modern looking** document is absolutely worth it.

I recommend creating a free account at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)  
(not sponsored, and I genuinely use this myself), and using one of  
their professional templates for designing your CV. There are many great  
options to choose from – just search for 'Professional CV'.

Keep your CV to **1 page**. I have worked a decade in the visual effects industry, and if I can fit my experience on one page, so can you.

Above all, your CV should be **easy to read**. Present the information in your CV concisely, and **avoid large walls of text**. Make sure to leave space to breathe throughout.

**Make clear, distinct sections**  
in your CV for the various information. Separate them using lines if  
needed. It will help to give the reader’s eyes a break in between  
segments. Your CV should be **easily scannable** so they can find the information they need right away, and **easily skimmable** so they can get a good idea of how eligible you are as a candidate quickly.

**Make use of bullet points**. They are a great way of presenting information

- Clearly

- Succinctly

**Use a clean font**.  
Personally, I use Raleway but there are tons of great options. I would  
go with a modern, sans serif, font. Avoid dated or silly looking fonts  
such as Times New Roman or Comic Sans.

# Content

Regardless of how you design your CV, there is certain information that you should include.

### Name, Title & Description

At the top of your CV, put **your full name in large letters**. Don't write Curriculum Vitae or CV. That is self-evident and redundant.

I like to put my picture next to my name but this is optional. If you do use a picture, pick a **nice, simple headshot** of yourself with a clean background. Smiling is very welcomed and gives off positive vibes and a good first impression.

Under your name, put **your title**. This should be short and sweet, like _Compositor_, _Lead Compositor_, _Compositing Supervisor_,  
etc. Unless you are clearly a senior or above, I wouldn’t put your  
level in there. That is up to the company you’re applying for to decide.  
If you have one year of experience as a compositor and write “Mid-level  
Compositor”, that just shows lack of self-judgement. You **don’t** want a recruiter to stop and **second-guess anything** on your CV.

Next, add a **short description** of yourself and why you are great at this role. This should only be 1-3 sentences. Highlight some of your top qualities.

As an example, mine says:

_Experienced_  
_in leading and compositing visual effects for both high-end television_  
_and feature film. I fuse exceptional efficiency with precision, which_  
_are founded on an extensive set of skills, production proven techniques_  
_and a strong work ethic._

With all of the above, the recruiter will have an initial idea of **who you are** and **what role you are applying for** after just the first few seconds of looking at your CV.

### Contact Information

Moving on, add a contact information section where you put your **phone number** (include the country code if relevant), your **email address**, and the **city** you live in. You don't need to write your full address. If and when you get hired, you'll share that information.

### Links

Next up, add links to your:

- **Website**: This should be your professional portfolio and/or industry related  
    website. If you have a website for a hobby such as photography or a  
    skill related to compositing, that’s also a good idea to include.

- **Showreel**: This will typically be a password protected Vimeo link – remember to include the password!

- **IMDb page**: Many of you will have an IMDb page. Make sure to keep it up to date and add credits for shows that you have worked on – if and when you are  
    allowed to. It’s a good reference for recruiters to look at and get an  
    idea of both the type and standard of projects you have been involved  
    in. Here is [how to add credits on IMDb](https://help.imdb.com/article/contribution/filmography-credits/adding-filmography-credits/GAB5B33MBLEG73CT#).

- **LinkedIn profile**: Keep your LinkedIn profile up to date just like your CV. Your LinkedIn  
    profile is also an opportunity to flesh out the details of your career,  
    skills, awards, etc. as it doesn't need to be compressed down to a  
    single page. Keep it concise and digestible, still. It should have  
    bullet points and white space similar to your CV.

**Write the links out in full**, just in case the recruiter needs to copy or type them elsewhere, or in the event the CV is printed out. So, write [www.linkedin.com/in/kennkalvik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennkalvik) instead of [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennkalvik). The latter one printed out won’t do much good.

Make sure that any links that you include are **functioning properly**. Test them, and double check that they work correctly.

### Custom URLs

You can make a **custom URL for your LinkedIn profile** by going to your LinkedIn profile page, and in the top right hand corner clicking on _Edit public profile & URL_:

[![](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/Edit_Public_LI_Profile_-_URL.png)](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/Edit_Public_LI_Profile_-_URL.png)

Then, on the newly opened page in the top right hand corner, click on the little pen symbol next to the URL to edit it:

[![](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/Edit_Custom_LI_URL.png)](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/Edit_Custom_LI_URL.png)

Just having your name at the end like I have  
done is good. It’s much easier to remember than a string of random  
letters, symbols, and numbers that the default link might consist of.

If you happen to have a paid version of Vimeo, you can also add a **custom URL to your showreel**.  
This is much less important, as Vimeo links are fairly short anyway and  
only use numbers, which means they’re easier to type if needed.

But if you wanted to do it; when you upload your showreel, click on the _Share link_ button in the top right hand corner (the chain link), and choose your preferred URL:

[![](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/Vimeo_Custom_Link.png)](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/Vimeo_Custom_Link.png)

Example of a custom showreel URL. (The example link is not active).

### Experience

Continuing down on your CV, your professional experience should be listed in **reverse chronological order**: the most recent jobs first, and the oldest last.

Aim to only **list relevant jobs**. If you worked as a welder on an oil rig eight years ago, it’s most likely _not_  
necessary to list that under your experience when applying for a  
compositing role. (You can let that be an interesting anecdote in the  
interview instead).

It’s not important to separately list every small company you worked freelance for years and years ago; you can **group jobs together** if needed. Let your LinkedIn profile keep the individual records for reference.

For each job, include:

- The year(s) you worked there

- The company name and office location

- Your job title

- A short description of the role and what you achieved

In the description, you can list the responsibilities you had in each role, but more importantly, **emphasise contributions and results**.  
If you built specific tools and templates for a big sequence on a show,  
mention that. Or, if you performed particularly well on a project,  
include details and metrics. This will help cement your value to the  
recruiter.

For example:

“Developed the look for the Gravi-Ray Gun  
disintegration effect and built a template used in over 60 shots by 10  
compositors on Astro Wars.”

That short sentence tells the recruiter a whole lot of good things about you as a compositor.

### Education

Like with your experience, your education should also be **listed in reverse chronological order**.

Unless you have multiple relevant degrees and/or have completed several relevant training courses, I would only add the **latest, most relevant one** – for example your university degree. There is no need to include your high school degree if you went to university.

For each relevant education, include:

- The year(s) you went to university or took a training course

- The university or training course’s name and location

- The title of your degree

- Optional: Your marks, if excellent

- A short description of the course and what you achieved

Similar to the job descriptions, focus on what you accomplished and _how_ what you studied is relevant to the job that you are applying for.

For example:

- Awarded a Distinction

- Studied creative and technical compositing of visual effects using Nuke

- Gained a strong knowledge of industry practices and production proven techniques

### Awards/Achievements

If you, or a team that you were a part of,  
have won a prestigious award or achieved something great in the visual  
effects industry (published research, won a scholarship, contributed  
tools and tutorials to the community which have been recognised, etc.),  
it’s great to list that on your CV. It’s again all about **giving the recruiter tangible metrics** to help judge your skill level and value.

Your awards and achievements can be listed in  
reverse chronological order, but they don’t necessarily have to be. You  
can also list them in order of prestige or importance. Whichever way  
you prefer, include the name of the award, the year, and optionally, the  
issuer. It can be brief: you will have more space to flesh out the  
details on your LinkedIn profile.

### Expertise

It’s a good idea to list a few skills that  
you excel at on your CV, to draw the recruiter’s attention to what your  
strengths are. It could be Compositing in Nuke, Team Management, Tool  
Building, Python Scripting, Visual Development, etc. A **short and sweet bullet point list** is your friend in this section of your CV.

**Don’t include visual skill bars**. They are completely arbitrary and do not prove anything. What does… _eyeballing_…  
roughly 80% skilled in Nuke even mean? There is no frame of reference.  
Instead, just list Nuke as an expertise and let the recruiter be the  
judge of your skill level.

Be ready to **back up your claims**. If you list a skill in the Expertise section, the _Experience_ section of your CV should reinforce why that is your expertise.

For example, if you list Team Management in  
the Expertise section, you have to back that up by including what you  
did to make you a great team manager, in the Experience section.

Some examples:

- Managed a team of [number] compositors, delivering [number] shots for [the show].

- Provided accurate shot briefs and creative and technical feedback to artists.

- Developed advanced Nuke tools and  
    templates for artists to produce creative effects and technical  
    composites, and to ensure visual continuity across sequences.

- Built and maintained informative show wikis and sophisticated ShotGrid pages for the artists.

- Held bi-weekly online training  
    sessions for the compositing and roto/prep teams company-wide, teaching  
    advanced techniques in Nuke.

- Acted as the central point of contact for artist queries and troubleshooting.

That way, the recruiter will know that your claims are not invented out of thin air. There is **substance** to them.

### Languages

If you are multilingual, and especially if  
one or more of your languages are relevant to the job, list them on your  
CV. You might be applying for a job in a foreign office, and even  
though most people speak English, being able to speak their native  
language is a great bonus. Be honest about your proficiency in each  
language you list, though.

### Hobbies

If you like, feel free to add a Hobbies  
section to your CV to further build the impression of who you are as a  
person. Bonus points if your hobbies are related to compositing. It's  
great if you are a bit specific here, like for example putting _macro-photography_ or _landscape photography_, instead of just _photography_.

# Language & Tone Of Voice

We are not lawyers or doctors, and our work  
language reflects that. There is no need to be overly formal in your  
writing. That’s not to say you should go full-blown casual, and use  
slang and an overload of emojis. Keep it professional, still. You  
wouldn’t wear a suit to an interview for a compositor role, but not a  
one-sie, either. Keep your CV, and your dress code, to **smart casual**.

**Use positively charged verbs** that help establish you as an authority in the subject, such as provided, managed, developed, or built.

**Use an active voice** instead of a passive voice when writing ("I composited the shot…" versus "the shot was composited by me…").

**Keep sentences short**. Your CV should be an easy read for the recruiter.

Make sure to **spell check the entire CV**.  
Triple check, and get others to look at it as well. Ensure there are no  
typos, and that sentences are grammatically correct. This will help  
give the recruiter a good impression of you when they read your CV.

# References

As part of their hiring process, some recruiters may ask for one or two references who can vouch for you.

A reference should be someone in a position  
above yours. Someone who supervised you and has a good understanding of  
how you work. And importantly – someone who has got a positive  
impression of you.

There is no need to put “References provided  
upon request” on your CV. If references are required, they will be  
requested. Having said that, if they _are_ required for the application process you should **prepare your references**.

First of all, **ask them for their consent beforehand**. And if they agree to be your reference, let them know **when they should be expecting a call or email**.

If required, provide the recruiter with:

- The reference’s full name

- Their job title and company

- Their email address

- Their telephone number (include the country code if relevant)

Make sure to spell check all of the reference’s information.

# Filetype And Filename

The filetype of your CV should be the  
industry standard PDF. Saving it as a PDF ensures the formatting stays  
correct and that it is viewable on any type of computer or device the  
recruiter might be using.

The filename should at minimum include the word CV and your full name:

_CV_Kenn_Hedin_Kalvik.pdf_

This will make it easy to find and to be recognised by the recruiter.

You could also add the current year at the end of the filename. Especially, if you are reapplying to a company after some time:

_CV_Kenn_Hedin_Kalvik_2022.pdf_

Make sure to spell check the filename.

# Copy/Paste

Frustratingly for you as a job seeker, some  
companies require a separate form to be filled out on their applications  
page, with all the information you already put in your CV. If you’re  
interested in working for the company you’ll just have to bite the  
bullet and copy/paste everything into the form.

  

# Why You Should Level Up Your Job Application

VFX studios sometimes receive hundreds of  
applications per month, and so it’s your job to make sure that yours  
doesn't end up in the "no" pile.

The way you write your application directly affects your chances of **convincing the recruiter to invite you for an interview**.

Your application may very well be your first  
point of contact – the first time the recruiter is digitally introduced  
to you as a person, and as a candidate for the role. Everything in it  
should be tailored to **make the best first impression possible**.

# Clean Up Your Online Image

First things first, be mindful of your online  
presence. Recruiters may look you up when you apply for a role, and you  
want to be presenting a positive online image.

Do a full audit _before_  
you apply for any roles, and clean up your online activity if needed.  
Google yourself to see what’s out there. Set social media posts to  
private, and/or **remove questionable material**  
from blog posts, comments, photos, etc. – anything that doesn’t reflect  
well on you, or doesn’t represent your current maturity level.

As an example, if you wrote a post where you  
went off on an expletive-filled rant about your former employer – that  
may make you come across as belligerent and difficult to work with. No  
matter how right you may or may not have been about them, it's best to  
remove it, or at the very least make it private.

# Update Your Public Profiles

Next, make sure to keep your professional  
social media pages up to date. Your LinkedIn profile in particular. But  
even your Twitter profile or other sites that you use publicly with your  
name.

Let's say for example that you just moved  
from Australia to London and are looking for a job. Make sure to update  
your online profiles with your **new city**. Likewise, update them with your **latest title** and **experience**, matching to your CV. Any new contact information such as a **new telephone number** should also be updated.

Recruiters may search for compositors in  
London, and if your profile is outdated and still says that you are a  
roto/prep artist living in Australia you’ll get lost in the cracks.

Also, update your LinkedIn profile and other professional profiles to show recruiters that you’re **open to work**.

To do that on LinkedIn, click on the **Open to** button on your profile, and select **Finding a new job**:

[![](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/OpenToWork1.png)](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/OpenToWork1.png)

Then, choose the options that are relevant to you before clicking **Add to profile**:

[![](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/OpenToWork2.png)](https://www.keheka.com/content/images/2022/11/OpenToWork2.png)

Put yourself out there, you want to **be easily found**.

# How To Write Your Application

Once you have done all the prep work above  
(including everything in parts 1-4 of this guide), you’ll be ready to  
start writing applications.

First, let’s consider what you need to demonstrate in the application to make you a **desirable candidate**.

### What Do They Want

The recruiter is ultimately looking for two things:

1. **Do you meet their criteria**? Show that you match the requirements for the role _and_ are a good fit for the team.

1. **Do you stand out** among the other applicants? Other candidates may have similar  
    qualifications. What gives you the edge? Lean into what makes you unique and demonstrably better than the rest of the pack.

When you write your application, the two points above should be your **overarching themes**. Everything should lead back to specifically answering those two questions with **YES**.

### Objectives For Each Application

So let’s break it down, how can we get the recruiter to say yes to the two questions above?

- **Personalise your application** for each company. Don’t just swap out the company name. Show that you  
    have put the time and effort into researching the company (e.g. history, culture, projects, people), and the role (e.g. skill requirements, job  
    responsibilities, skill preferences—this can be a good way to stand  
    out!). Only include what’s relevant specifically to them and that  
    particular role. (It’s easier to spot generic copy/paste applications  
    than you might think!)

- Demonstrate that you are a **well-rounded individual** with the skills, aptitude, and personality to do the job and to fit into the company. **Make a strong connection** between the role requirements and your specific skills. Write in a **friendly and polite** way. Make it easy for the recruiter to visualise you in the role.

- Focus on how you have **positively impacted your day-to-day work** using relevant, real life examples from your experience. (Don't be afraid to sell yourself!)

- **Select relevant examples** from your achievements to back up any claims you make. If you state  
    that you are organised, then concisely describe exactly what you do/have done that makes you organised.

- **Avoid sounding desperate** or _too_ eager. Instead of highlighting your need for employment, focus on how  
    you can be a great asset to the company. What do you have to offer _them_?

- **Convey your (genuine!) enthusiasm**. Show that you _want_ to work for the company. But keep in mind the point above. You don’t need them, you want them. Communicate why they excite you.

- Show the best version of yourself, but **be truthful**. Honesty is the best policy. Don't list skills that you don't have, and  
    don’t alter your grades. Paint yourself in a good light, sure – but a  
    true one. Dishonesty backfires.

- **Avoid sloppy mistakes**. Don’t give the recruiter any reason to discard your application. Use  
    the correct names and information, and proofread everything. An  
    application clearly meant for another company will by default go  
    straight into the bin.

### Tips for Wording Your Application

The way you write your application matters. It’s important to successfully get your points across in a way that makes an impact.

- Keep sentences and paragraphs **short and to the point**. Your application should be easily readable. Avoid superfluous phrases  
    and long clauses such as ‘having worked in…’ which only serve as dead  
    weight in your sentences.

- **Use straightforward words**. Your application should be _clear_, rather than clever. The recruiter shouldn’t have to reach for a  
    dictionary to be able to understand what you are trying to say.

- **Use an active voice**, just like in your CV. ‘I solved the problem’ sounds punchier than ‘The problem was solved by me’.

- **Don’t be vague**. Sentences like ‘I doubled down and worked hard on the problem…’ don’t  
    specify anything and are pretty useless to a recruiter for judging your  
    skills.

- **Reduce the number of adjectives and adverbs**. Having too many makes sentences sound clunky. If your verb or adjective doesn’t feel powerful or precise enough, instead of using an adverb to  
    add more colour, try finding a stronger verb or adjective instead. (A  
    basic example would be: Very good → Great).

- **Avoid nominalisations** (i.e. turning verbs into nouns) – they hide the real action and sound too formal. Compare for instance the following:
    
    _Involved with the implementation of three Python scripts for XYZ…_
    
    versus
    
    _Implemented three Python scripts for XYZ…_
    
    The latter just sounds and flows better. _And_ it is shorter, which helps **reduce your word count**.
    

- **Avoid clichés**. Everybody else is also a motivated, passionate, detail oriented team  
    player. Use different words to describe yourself, and stand out.
    
    This extends further: **avoid overused phrases** such as ‘I am writing to express my interest…’ as they only blend you further in with the rest of the applicants.
    

- **Avoid negatives**. Don’t say that you want to apply for the job because you are bored with what you are currently doing, don’t like the people at your job, or  
    aren’t being paid well enough. Reframe it in a positive way. For  
    example, this would be an opportunity to better apply your skills and  
    contribute to inspiring projects.

- Study the job description and **reference the keywords** they’ve used in your application. You can also use synonyms. Relate  
    your experience to the job responsibilities and skill requirements to  
    make it easier for the recruiter to tick boxes.
    
    However, don't just regurgitate paragraphs word for word. Be tactful;  
    including a few subtle references is sufficient. It shows you took the  
    time to read the job description and tailor your application to the  
    company.
    

- **Read the application out loud**. Does it flow well? Does it make sense (to a recruiter)? Get a second opinion from someone else if you can.
    
    💡 You can copy your application into [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) and listen to it playing back. You may catch mistakes you’ve previously missed.
    

### Email Application

With that in mind, let’s start with how to write an email application. It will typically follow this 8-step framework:

1. **Start with a clear and concise subject line**. The position you're applying for, the job reference number, your name,  
    and/or whichever relevant information that’s required – as succinctly as possible. The recruiter should immediately know what the email is  
    about.

1. **Address the recruiter**. Greet them using their first name, e.g. ‘Hi John’ or ‘Dear John’. Do  
    NOT write ‘Dear Sir/Madam’ or ‘To whom it may concern’. It is very  
    off-putting – not only the formality of it, but also the fact that you  
    didn’t even spend the time to find out which person to address the  
    application to. It shows a lack of effort, and that will definitely  
    reflect negatively on you. If you absolutely cannot find a name, at the  
    very least write ‘Dear Hiring Manager’.

1. **State the reason for your email**. Continue the body of the email by being clear about the intention  
    behind your contacting the recruiter. Make it obvious that this email is a job application. ‘I read your post on LinkedIn earlier today about  
    [company name] recruiting for compositors, and…’ – or something to that  
    extent.

1. **Highlight a mutual connection**. Mention who referred you to this job, who you know in the company, or  
    any relevant connection which links you to this particular role or  
    studio. If you know someone they trust, and that person can vouch for  
    you, your odds of getting the role skyrockets.
    
    Or, if you don’t have a mutual connection, you can:
    
    **Bring up a recent event, specific fact, notable statistic, or award** the company has recently won. A bit of _subtle_  
    flattery tied into why you admire the company and want to work for  
    them. Subtle being the keyword, you don’t want to come across as a  
    brown-nose.
    

1. **Market yourself**. Lead with an impressive accomplishment. How did you add value during  
    your previous experience? Connect that with how you can apply it to the  
    new role. Show how you are passionate about what you do. Keep it brief  
    and interesting.

1. **Include a link to your showreel** (and the password, if applicable). You want to make it as easy as a single click for them to watch your work.

1. **Thank them for their time**. End your email with gratitude.

1. **Attach your CV** to the email. Once you’ve piqued the recruiter’s interest with your  
    application and impressed them with your showreel, your CV will fortify  
    their belief in your abilities.

### Online Application Portals

Many VFX companies have their own job portal  
on their website. If you are applying through an online portal, all of  
the above still applies but there are a few more things to keep in mind:

- Carefully **read ALL of the instructions first** (on the whole application form), so that you can fill in the  
    information correctly. Show attention to detail – are you answering  
    their questions correctly? A field may call for yes/no answers, a couple of sentences, a full paragraph, or more. There may be two or three  
    sub-questions included in a question. Make sure to answer all of them.

- **Fill everything out independently** in for example a Google Docs document, and copy/paste the text into the online form. That way, you can proofread it more easily, and avoid  
    losing any work. Sometimes, accidentally returning to the previous page  
    will delete everything you filled in. Save yourself the time and  
    trouble.
    
    💡 Check if there is a word count limit per field, and that none of the text you paste in gets cut off.
    

- Be careful if you are copying material over from another application; **don’t include the name (or other specifics) of the other company**. You’ll run the risk of the application being discarded, or at the very  
    least your initial chances of getting an interview being drastically  
    lowered.

- **Put ‘N/A’ in any field that does not apply** to you (unless it states that you should leave it blank), to show that you have considered the question.

- Make sure that you **attach any requested documents** such as your CV, your cover letter, or your proof of right to work.
    
    💡 Even if a CV is not requested it can be a good idea to attach it  
    anyway. An excellent CV can help make you stand out, even if the  
    recruiter only glances at it.
    

- Once again, if your showreel is password protected, remember to **include the password**! Some online forms will have a field for the password. If not, insert it somewhere appropriate like under ‘Additional Information’.

- **Keep a copy** of the application for reference. (See the section further below about tracking your applications).

### How To Write Your Cover Letter

Some companies will ask you to include a cover letter with your application.

The cover letter will essentially consist of  
the previously described points that you would put in the body of an  
email application. However, it doesn’t have to be _as_  
brief. It should still be concise, mind you, only a few paragraphs at  
the most. You're not applying to be the first person to visit Mars, and  
there is no need for a detailed life story. The recruiter doesn't have  
time to read pages after pages.

The cover letter should **paint a clear picture**  
of who you are, though. It serves as a way to introduce yourself to the  
employer, to let them know about your skill set, and to explain what  
you can contribute to them and why you would be a good fit for the role.

Your goal is to make a **well-structured, well-argued case** that you are the right person for the job.

Like your application, it should be uniquely **tailored to the company and role**. Give specific examples from your past experience that directly relate to the job specifications.

But **don’t just copy/paste**  
from your CV. The cover letter is an opportunity to flesh out your  
persona. Use new examples and different words to provide strong evidence  
of specific skills or job experience required for the role. Make it a  
worthwhile read.

💡 You can also use the cover letter as an opportunity to explain gaps in your CV.

There is a slight difference between writing a  
cover letter for a speculative application versus responding to a job  
listing or applying for a specific role. You should still highlight what  
makes you a great compositor, but you won't have a job description to  
mirror.

A good idea is to look up other companies' **job listings for the same role**.  
They often look for similar qualities in a candidate. Leverage that.  
And, really research the company and draw in points directly related to  
them in your cover letter. You'll have to lean harder into that aspect  
in order to properly tailor it to them.

Make sure to **proofread everything**, and check for formatting errors. Then, save the file as a **PDF** and name it in a clear way:

_Cover_Letter_Kenn_Hedin_Kalvik_2022.pdf_

Lastly, **keep a copy** for reference.

### Discrimination

It’s useful to know about your rights,  
especially if you are unsure about what to include in your application.  
In the United Kingdom, you are [protected by law](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents) from discrimination based on:

- Age

- Disability

- Gender reassignment

- Marriage or civil partnerships

- Pregnancy or maternity leave

- Race

- Religion

- Sex

- Sexual orientation

**It’s up to you whether you want to disclose**  
any such information in your application or not. This also applies if  
you are associated with anyone with these protected characteristics  
(e.g. family member or friend).

If any of this applies to you and you are not in the UK, please look up the laws for your specific country.

### Final Checks

Before you send your application, double check the following:

- Are you sending the application from a **credible email address**? Your.Name@gmail.com sounds a whole lot better than 420Blazeit94@hotmail.com. You want to be taken seriously as an applicant.

- Have you included a **useful subject line** in the application email? Like mentioned above, it could be the  
    position you're applying for, the job reference number, your name,  
    and/or whichever relevant information that’s required.

- Is the application **addressed to the correct person**? Avoid writing ‘Hi, James’, if the person's name is actually John.  
    Likewise, if you mention their company in your application, make sure  
    you **use the right company name**. Copy/pasting between multiple applications can be a faux pas trap.

- Have you **included the relevant attachments** to the application? The most important ones being your CV and cover  
    letter. While the link to your showreel and the password usually go in  
    the body of the email, or in a specific field in the online form, make  
    sure you’ve included those as well.

- Have you **followed all the instructions** in the job listing and/or application portal? Take some time to go over everything again and review.

- Have you **spell checked the whole application**? Triple check, and get others to look at it as well. Ensure there are no typos or grammatically incorrect sentences.

- **Have you kept a copy** of the application (and any attachments)? You might not get access to it again. As you will learn in [Part 6: Nail Your Interview](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-6-nail-your-interview/) of this guide, it's useful to refer back to what you told them in your application when preparing for the interview.
    
    💡 Save a copy of every application for reference. You can name the documents _[Year_Month_Date]_[Company_Name]_Application.pdf_ and save them to a folder called _Job_Applications_.  
    That way, they automatically get sorted in chronological order on your  
    computer. Or, sort them by Company name first, if you prefer to group  
    them that way.
    

Once you are confident that everything is in  
excellent shape, hit send and hope for the best! Don’t wait until the  
deadline (if there is one); send in a strong application early and **position yourself as a leading candidate**. If you have followed everything in this guide so far, you will certainly have increased your chances of getting noticed.

# Keep Track Of Your Applications

Although I would recommend sending fewer,  
more targeted applications, chances are you will have to send a lot of  
them before any company bites. And a couple dozen applications can be a  
lot to keep track of in your mind.

You might get a call and not be entirely  
certain who that person was again, or which company they represent. It's  
better to lay out all the pertinent information in a structured way,  
making it quick and easy to reference.

Set up a spreadsheet or make a list containing:

- The company name

- The job title

- Whether you have applied yet or not

- How you applied (Email, LinkedIn, Online portal, etc.)

- The date you applied

- The contact person

- Whether you have followed up with them or not

- The date you followed up

- Whether you have been invited to an interview with that company or not

- The date of the interview

- Whether you have received an offer from them or not

- The salary they offered

- Other benefits they offered

- Any other notes you may have

That way, you can keep track of all your  
applications and interviews, know when it's time to follow up with the  
contact person, and compare offers.

I have made a [Job Application Tracker template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12cqXUIxSNGNLus0mOB98D_DGZTuKPsiJePW6FTWC0fI/edit?usp=drivesdk)  
in Google Docs which you can make a copy of (File → Make a copy), and  
then use yourself. It has dropdown menus for the yes/no questions, and  
conditional formatting to change colours of cells based on your answers  
for easy tracking.

Job Application Tracker template in Google Docs.

Having an organised spreadsheet like this  
makes it easier to follow up on time, and even to reapply a few months  
later if needed.

And because you also saved copies of all your  
applications, you will know what you wrote last time and whether you  
already have set up an account on a company's online job portal or not.

You will also know exactly what someone is talking about if they call you concerning an interview.

# What Happens Next

Recruiters may get dozens or even hundreds of  
applications per role, and have multiple roles advertised at any one  
point. Once received, your application will first go through a **screening process**  
where the most obviously unsuitable applications will be discounted.  
This process might not take place until after a certain amount of  
applications have been gathered, to make it easier to decide on the best  
ones.

So, expect it to take **several days or weeks before you hear back**.  
(If you are unsuccessful, you will often only be notified after the  
final candidate has been hired – if you get notified at all).

**Check for any important dates or deadlines**.  
If the application window is still open for two more weeks after you  
applied, the recruiting team might not start reviewing applications  
until the period ends. (Luckily, many companies will not have these  
windows or deadlines, and start reviewing after only a couple of days).  
Add any time remaining in the application window on top of your expected  
waiting time.

There is usually a lot of competition and the waiting game can be disappointing. The length of time before you hear back **depends on multiple factors**,  
such as project urgency, key people being available in the recruitment  
process, schedules, or just general good or bad timing. Someone may be  
off on holiday or sick when you apply.

While you wait, continue researching the  
company, the recruiter, and the Head of Compositing. If you’re lucky,  
you might get called for an interview quickly, so spend the time to **prepare ahead**.

If you have a connection in the company,  
reach out to them and ask if there is anything you should know about  
which can help the process. Even more importantly, ask if they can **put in a good word for you**.

If you don’t hear back from the recruiter, **follow up after two weeks**.  
Politely ask about the status of the job. They’ll be able to let you  
know if the role is still available or has been filled, if the team is  
still sorting through applications, or if interviews have started. **Check in periodically**, especially with recruiting firms. Let them know you are still on the market, and keep your name fresh in their minds.

The good news is that positive decisions are  
the easiest to make, and those who tick all the boxes will be  
immediately shortlisted for an interview. The challenge is if there is  
no ‘perfect’ candidate, and they have to go through a more **systematic process** to decide who will progress to the next stage. In those cases it may take longer to hear back.

Just be patient.

### How To Deal With Rejection

It can be disheartening to get rejected,  
especially if you put a lot of time and effort into an application.  
Instead of letting your confidence take a hit, just keep in mind that **it's completely normal** to apply to several jobs before being successful.

Reply back and **politely thank them**  
for their time reviewing you as a candidate. Ask that they retain your  
information and keep you in mind for future opportunities.

Then, don’t dwell on it – **move on**. Keep refining your skills and polishing up your applications, and eventually your time will come.

**Apply to other jobs**.  
It will help reduce the stress of having an application be rejected,  
while increasing your chances of actually getting a job. With more  
options on the table, you can relax a bit more and not obsess over any  
one position/application.

**Apply again a few months later**.  
Spend the time in between to improve your showreel, CV and application,  
and come back stronger the second time around. Just don’t barrage them  
with the same application. Improve it every time and wait at least three  
months in between sending each one.

If your application is solid, even if you were unsuccessful the first time, you’ll be added to a **pool of potential future candidates**. You may find that you get contacted later on for an available position.

### What Happens When You Succeed

If you are successful with your application  
and get called for an interview, it can be very exciting and a bit  
nerve-wracking. Only the top candidates are called for interviews, so  
remember that **you are doing well so far**.

Reply back and politely thank them for the invitation, and then **schedule an interview** at a time that suits you both.

If you have spent your time well you should  
already be quite prepared. However, there is still work to do – which we  
will dive into in the next part of this guide.

# Why You Should Level Up Your Interview Skills

What you research, how you prepare, and the way you come across during the interview **directly affect your chances of being offered the position**.

As you will remember from Part 5 of this guide, recruiters are looking for two things:

1. **Do you meet their criteria**? That is, do you match the requirements for the role _and_ are you a good fit for the team?

1. **Do you stand out** among the other applicants? Do you have an edge over candidates with similar qualifications?

The interview is your chance to **clearly demonstrate that you satisfy both** of the above.

# Research & Preparation

The better you research and prepare ahead of the interview, the better your chances are of standing out.

### Confirm The Interview Details

Start off with the basics. Confirm that you have **all the correct details** for the interview:

- The full name(s) of the interviewer(s).

- The date and time (and time zone, if applicable).

- The address, if meeting in person.

- The video meeting link, and password (if applicable).

- The phone number, for example if you are connecting into a conference call.

- Any other specific instructions given to you about the interview.

### Learn About The Interviewer(s)

**Research the interviewer(s)** ahead of the interview. Remember, they are people just like you, with their own lives and interests.

Look them up on Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. **Find some common ground**  
with them. What are they interested in? Having a bit of background  
knowledge can make the initial small talk before the interview a lot  
more interesting and engaging.

Think about it, what's more fun: talking  
about the weather, or, about their recent windsurfing trip to Maui and  
your mutual love for the sport?

The latter will definitely create a stronger connection. The **conversation will flow better**, and then segue into the interview portion more naturally.

Show interest in them and impress them with your research, but **avoid coming across as a stalker**.  
Keep it light and limit your talking points about them to one or two  
things. Gauge their reaction; if they become enthusiastic you are on the  
right track.

💡 The person(s) scheduled to interview you might change last minute  
due to unforeseen circumstances. It's a good idea to think of a couple  
more general talking points for small talk as well.

### Refresh Your Memory

When you prepare for the interview, refer  
back to what you wrote in the application. You may have to elaborate on  
or back up any claims that you put in your CV, showreel, or in the  
application email/form. And you want to come across as consistent.

Be prepared to **talk in detail about each shot** in your showreel:

- Which project was it for?

- What did you contribute specifically?

- Which problems did you encounter?

- Which skills and techniques did you use to solve them?

- What would you improve?

You should also be able to **speak about the specifics of each experience** on your CV:

- What were your responsibilities?

- What did you contribute, and how?

- Which challenges did you face?

- How did you overcome them?

- Which skills did you learn?

- How do they directly relate to the role you are applying for?

### Practise Common Interview Questions

In my experience from both sides of the  
table, some interview questions tend to come up more often than others.  
Below is a selection of the more common questions that you may encounter  
during the interview. Keep in mind, these questions come in **many different variations**:

- **Could you tell us a little bit about yourself?**
    
    Interviews often start out with this question, and it's a chance for you to give a great first impression. You should give a **brief overview** of your experience, aspirations, and motivations – and relate it all to the role you are applying for.
    
    You can follow the **Present, Past, Future**  
    structure to answer the question. First, talk about your current role  
    and perhaps a recent achievement. Next, explain how you got to where you  
    are by describing your past experience. Remember to choose examples  
    relevant to the role you're applying for. Finally, segue into what you  
    want to do next and why this particular role interests you.
    
    💡 You can change the order around if that works better for you, e.g. Past, Present, Future.
    

- **What do you know about our company?**
    
    This  
    question is asked to check whether or not you have put any effort into  
    preparing for the interview and if you are actually interested in the  
    company, rather than seeing it as just another job. It serves to  
    highlight if you are motivated.
    
    You aren't expected to list the  
    entire history of the company (please don't), but you should at least  
    include a few noteworthy points and recent achievements. What makes the  
    company interesting to you?
    

- **Why do you want to work for us?**
    
    This  
    question also relates to your motivation, but you shouldn't just list  
    all the things you love about them and how working there would be a  
    great next step in your career.
    
    Your answer should focus more on what _you_ can do for _them_. Include things like:
    
    - Your direct knowledge of the company and their projects.
    
    - Your experience in compositing and related fields, and how it would benefit them.
    
    - Your experience on projects of a similar calibre, or in teams of a similar size to theirs.
    

- **Are you more creative or technical?**
    
    This  
    question is asked to find out how you would fit into the team, which  
    types of projects you could be a good match for, what support you might  
    need, and the type of work they could expect to assign to you.
    
    Compositors are usually a bit of both but if you lean towards one or the other, let them know which is your strongest.
    

- **How do you see your career progressing over the next few years?**
    
    This  
    question is asked to find out what your plans and aspirations are for  
    the future. Are you looking for a short-term or long-term role? Are you  
    looking to move abroad anytime soon? Would you want to pursue a career  
    path within the company (which fits with what they have to offer)?
    

- **Do you prefer working from home, in the office, or a hybrid?**
    
    Most  
    companies offer all of the above nowadays. This question is asked to  
    find out about your preferences and your situation, and what they would  
    need to provide you with equipment-wise.
    
    Can you only work from  
    home due to your distance from the office? If so, do you need a Teradici  
    machine, a Wacom tablet, or other hardware?
    
    Do you thrive around people and prefer to _only_ work in the office? Which arrangements should be made to give you an optimal work environment?
    
    Can  
    you only come in on certain days, or have to leave at a certain time?  
    You may have other commitments such as nursery pick-up.
    

- **Which types of shots do you enjoy working on the most, and which do you find difficult or cumbersome?**
    
    This  
    question is asked to find out which projects would be a good fit for  
    you. Do you love to composite large environments? Creatures? Sci-fi  
    spaceships? Are you a particle system wizard? Would you rather avoid  
    period dramas? Let them know what you like and dislike.
    

- **What are your strengths and weaknesses?**
    
    This  
    question is connected to the previous one above. It's an opportunity to  
    talk about what you are good at, and what you want to learn more about.
    
    Your strengths are often easy to list, but you might struggle  
    with your weaknesses. Think of them as areas for development. Pick  
    something that’s not a dealbreaker, but give an honest answer.
    
    Avoid  
    cop-out answers like ‘I’m a perfectionist’. Instead, something like 'I  
    would like to learn more about Deep compositing as this is an area  
    that's still new to me' is a much better answer.
    

- **Could you describe what you did in this shot?** (While looking at your showreel).If you just did the roto, or only partly contributed to the compositing work on a shot, be clear about it.
    
    This question is asked for two reasons:
    
    1. To verify that you actually did the work and know what you are talking about.
    
    1. To find out more about your contribution to the shot and how you approached it. Be specific about what you did  
        and which techniques you used to do it.
    

- **Do you have any questions for us?**
    
    Your  
    answer to this should be a definite yes. Prepare a list of questions  
    for the interviewer. This is your opportunity to interview them, and to  
    find out if they are a good fit for you. It's a chance to show your  
    interest in the company and role, and to display that you value  
    yourself.
    
    See the 'Remember It’s A Two-Way Interview' section below.
    

- **What are your salary expectations?**
    
    This  
    question might come up at the end of the interview, or in a follow-up  
    email after. It's a topic of its own which we'll dive into in [Part 7: Negotiate Great Terms](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-7-negotiate-great-terms/).
    

💡 On [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Interview/index.htm), you can look up interview questions that have been asked before by the company you are interviewing with.

Interviews for compositing roles **tend to be quite conversational**  
(as opposed to presentational), and may only last for about 30 minutes.  
And so you're not expected to go over your life story in detail. Your  
answers should be concise and to the point. Try to **avoid long monologues** for every question.

Some questions do require a more substantial response, though, and for those you can make use of the S.T.A.R. method.

### Use The S.T.A.R. Method

The S.T.A.R. method is a **framework for answering competency or behavioural questions**. These are questions such as:

- Could you talk a bit about a time when you dealt with a particularly challenging shot/sequence? (Or team member?)

- Could you give an example of how you show initiative at work?

- Could you describe a situation when you went above and beyond?

- Could you tell us about your proudest professional achievement?

These types of questions require a more **story-like response**; one where you provide a real-life example of how you handled a certain situation in the past.

The S.T.A.R. method is **great way of structuring a story**, and it's easy to remember:

- **Situation**. Set the scene and describe the situation you were in or the project  
    that needed to be done. You want to provide context for the rest of your story. Keep it concise – don’t include all sorts of unnecessary or  
    irrelevant details.

- **Task**. What was the task that _you_ were given (or took upon yourself) to fix the situation or to complete  
    the project? What was your goal? What were your responsibilities and  
    your core involvement with the objective? Explain where you fit into the puzzle.

- **Action**. What actions did _you_ take specifically to address the issue? Communicate your assessment of  
    the situation and your response to solve the problem. Describe each step you took, and explain your contribution with specifics.

- **Result**. What was the outcome of _your_ actions? Describe your results and quantify them with numbers where  
    possible. How did you make a difference? Any long-term effects? What did you learn?

If the question calls for it, you can add an extra R to the acronym, making it S.T.A.R.R.:

- **Reflect**. Would you have done anything differently? What steps have you taken to  
    improve for the next time? It can be useful to add this point if you’re  
    asked to talk about a situation that didn’t go as planned.

**Practise one or two sentences for each letter**  
of the acronym. (Add more sentences to the Action part of the story as  
needed, to provide enough details to support it). Together, they should  
form a relevant story of how you made a positive impact on for example  
the project, the team, the client, or the company.

**Prepare a few S.T.A.R. stories**  
ahead of the interview. Look at the job description to find which  
qualities and skills the company values in a candidate (which you should  
also have on your CV), and choose the most impressive stories from your  
experience that emphasise those. Practise them ahead of time with a  
colleague, friend and/or partner. Try to **get your points across in a natural, conversational way**. You don’t want to sound too rehearsed.

You _can_ **bring a small cheat sheet**  
with names, talking points, and numbers to help you during the  
interview, especially during remote interviews. Your notes should be  
short, though – just long enough to remind you what to talk about – so  
that you don’t come across as reading off a page when you’re answering.

The questions may come in different formats, so be prepared to **adapt your stories**  
to fit the question and the audience. Gauge the interviewer(s) and get a  
feel for what language to use, and how to tell your stories.

**Focus on what** _**you**_ **did**,  
and use 'I' instead of 'we' when you tell the story. This is about you,  
your workflow, and your achievements. You are the one being  
interviewed, not any member of your former team.

Avoid embellishing or omitting any important parts of the story. Just be honest, and pick stories where **the outcome reflects positively on you**.

Be specific when you tell the story; **give details to support it**. Avoid generalising or being vague. 'I worked hard on it' doesn't provide any useful information to the interviewer.

If you are asked more than one of these competency/behavioural types of questions, **use different examples** for each one to show the breadth of your experience.

💡 Expect to receive **follow-up questions** about the examples you give.

### Do A Practice Run

**Practise ahead of time**  
with a friend, partner, or colleague. It might sound silly or cringy,  
but record a mock interview between the two of you using for example the  
camera on your phone.

Recording the conversation and seeing  
yourself from a third person's perspective can give you valuable  
insights into how you behave.

You may **notice undesirable behaviours** that you weren't aware of before:

- Fidgeting nervously or subconsciously with a pen or other object.

- Interrupting the other person or speaking over them.

- Rambling on instead of giving concise answers.

- Speaking too quickly or too slowly, or having other issues with pacing.

- Using an excessive amount of ums and uhs.

- Speaking too loudly or too quietly, or having other issues with volume.

- Being too high energy or too low energy.

- Mumbling or having other problems with enunciation.

- Veering off topic.

- Speaking in a monotone voice or lacking dynamic emotion.

- Giving too much, or not enough, eye contact.

- Not smiling/laughing or bringing positive vibes to the conversation.

- Not being yourself.

Take note of your findings and actively practise to **change any undesirable behaviours** so that you can avoid or tone them down in conversation. But also **notice positive behaviours** which you would like to reinforce.

It’s important to scrutinise the _content_ of your recorded conversation, too. You may be able to **pinpoint answers you would like to improve**.  
Or, you might want to adjust the delivery of a certain story, or  
refocus an answer to reflect better on you. Take some time to develop  
your answers and make them sound more natural as opposed to too  
rehearsed.

### Remember It’s A Two-Way Interview

It can be easy to forget sometimes, especially when you are just starting out, but **you are also interviewing** _**them**_.  
Just as they want to find out if you are a great fit for their team,  
you should find out if they are the right company for you.

This is 50% of the reason why it's so important to research the company and **prepare questions ahead of the interview**.  
What do you want to know about them? What would help you make your  
decision when considering their offer versus one from another company?

You can ask about topics such as:

- The company culture

- Their overtime policy

- Typical team sizes

- Training opportunities

- Career paths within the company

- Why they like working for the company

- What a typical working day looks like

- Which types of projects the company is looking to pursue

- If the company is planning on expanding

- (If applicable to you) Whether there are options for transferring between different offices later on

- The length of the contract being offered for the role

Take some time to really think about what information could be useful to you. **Write your questions down in advance** so that you don’t forget them.

💡 Be non-confrontational with your questions. **It's not an interrogation** and you don't want to put them in a bad light, but rather find out if they are the right company for you.

### Calm Your Pre-Interview Nerves

It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous before an interview.

Keep in mind that just like you, **the interviewer** _**also**_ **wants you to succeed**  
(otherwise you wouldn’t have been invited to the interview). They want  
to fill the position with the best candidate, and they are hoping that  
you will be that person.

So if you are nervous, just keep that in the  
back of your mind. They are not looking to embarrass you or to reject  
you. Quite the opposite, in fact.

And, you'll find that **the better you prepare, the more relaxed you become**.

# Interview Formats

There are three main types of interviews:

- Over the phone

- In-person

- Via a video call

While much of the research and preparation  
will be the same for all three, let's look at what separates them, and  
which actions to take specifically for each one.

### Phone Interview

Some companies will do a round of candidate screenings over the phone first, before the actual face-to-face meeting.

A phone interview typically only lasts for  
about 15-20 minutes, and will rarely go over half an hour. While  
relatively short, it is still important because it determines whether or  
not you will go through to the next round of interviews. And so you  
should **treat it as any other interview**.

Do your research and prepare well, making  
sure to cover all of the steps mentioned so far in this guide. Just  
because it’s over the phone doesn’t mean you should be winging it.

Ahead of the call, wash your face with cold  
water, brush your teeth, do some pushups if you like, and listen to  
upbeat music. You want to be **awake and alert, and in a great mood**. It will translate well into your voice and your energy over the phone.

**Warm up your voice**  
before the call. Speak out loud for a while, especially if you only  
recently woke up. Clear any phlegm, drink some water, and warm up your  
vocal chords and your face muscles. On the phone call you should be able  
to **speak clearly**.

Put on clothes that you would wear for an  
interview in person (i.e. smart casual), and either stand up or sit in  
an office chair. You’ll **subconsciously feel more confident** and more switched on, than if you lounge on your sofa in your sweatpants.

Check that you **have enough battery left on your phone**. Or, **bring a charger**. You don’t want your phone to die in the middle of the interview.

Find a **quiet place with good phone reception**. If you struggle with a poor signal in your building, newer phones have a **Wi-Fi Calling** feature which does exactly what it says on the tin: make calls via your Wi-Fi connection. **Test it beforehand**, though, and make sure that it works. Otherwise, scout out an area with good reception in advance.

If you can, **use earbuds**  
with your phone. They help cut out surrounding noise and distractions,  
and wearing them lets you fully focus on the interviewer. Your hands  
will free up as well, for writing and gesturing during the call.

**Bring a pen and paper**  
so you can take any important notes during the call. Write down  
questions that arise or points you would like to expand upon when the  
interviewer is talking. That way, you don’t have to interrupt them if  
you lose track at any point. Keep your notes short to avoid taking up  
much time and concentration.

Have your CV, your research notes, and any other **relevant documents organised in front of you**. They are very useful as references when answering questions, and you want to be able to find what you need quickly.

**Don't chew gum or eat anything** during the call. **Bring a glass of water**  
in case your mouth gets dry or you get a tickle in your throat, but  
turn away slightly when you drink. Be respectful to the other person.

**Clear away surrounding distractions, and silence any devices** that may make a noise during the call.

**Be on time** and ready to pick up on the second or third ring. **Introduce yourself by name** to let them know they have reached the right person.

**Make sure to smile**  
during the call, even though they can't see you. Your smile can be  
heard in your voice. Gesturing while you speak will also inject emotion  
into your voice, and help make you come across more enthusiastic.

If you're super nervous, try to **be aware of the speed at which you're talking** and consciously slow down if needed. Keep your sentences fairly concise and avoid rambling.

**Let the interviewer guide the discussion**.  
They have certain questions they want to go over. Avoid going off on a  
tangent, or dominating the conversation with long, one-sided monologues.

The above **also applies to small talk**;  
let the interviewer decide on if and how much there should be. And let  
the interviewer interrupt you – it probably means they want to steer the  
conversation back on track. (Avoid interrupting them, though!).

**Don't gossip** or talk negatively about your employer or anyone else. Reframe any negative experiences into positive learning experiences.

**Listen carefully throughout**,  
and ask for clarification if something is unclear. When you can’t see  
the other person and their body language, it's easier to misunderstand  
things. Especially when combined with delayed or overlapping responses  
over the phone.

At the end of the call, make sure to **ask what the next steps are**. When will you hear back? What's the next part of the process? Take note of any deadline they give for getting back to you.

Then, right after the call, **jot down any last notes** you want to remember.

### In-Person Interview

Barring the obvious exceptions, the pointers above in the _Phone Interview_ section also apply to in-person interviews. However, there are additional things you should consider when meeting face-to-face:

If you are going to a physical office to meet the interviewer(s) in person, **plan the route**  
to getting there ahead of time. Check the traffic situation and parking  
options, or check for any delays to public transport. Make sure you can  
get there with plenty of time to spare.

**Look presentable**.  
The dress code is typically smart casual for compositing interviews.  
Shower, shave, brush your teeth, do your makeup, get a haircut – take  
the relevant steps to make sure that you look and feel your best and  
most confident.

If it isn't already, **switch your phone to silent mode** before entering the interview. The meeting should be free of any distractions.

Bring your showreel, CV, and any other requested documents on a **USB thumb drive** as a backup.

### Body Language

Actions speak louder than words, according to two studies by professor Albert Mehrabian. A whopping [55% of communication](https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/communication/how-much-of-communication-is-nonverbal/) may come down to body language. (38% in the tone of voice, and only 7% in the words you use).

[There are caveats](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-words/201109/is-nonverbal-communication-numbers-game) to these studies but in any case, much is communicated through your body language. So make it count:

- **Walk tall** and look forwards (not down) on your way into the interview. Be aware of your surroundings and smile at the people you pass.

- **Don’t go on your phone** if you have to wait in the reception area. Sit upright in a comfortable position while you wait.

- **Stand up and give firm handshakes** to everyone you're introduced to (unless it's a big group; in that case a smile and a quick wave is enough).

- **Make eye contact** with everyone you meet, and especially the interviewer(s). Don’t look  
    down or constantly scan back and forth across the room. It makes you  
    look distracted or apprehensive. Focus on them, but avoid staring.

- **Sit up straight** with your shoulders back, and slightly lean forward to show that you  
    are listening to the interviewer and engaged in the conversation. Avoid  
    slouching or making yourself look small. Although, don’t go too far or  
    you might appear stiff and unfriendly. Loosen up and find a good  
    balance.

- **Nod and smile genuinely**, and relatively often (when appropriate). It's extremely effective at  
    letting the other person know you're engaged in the conversation.  
    Tilting your head slightly also conveys that you're listening.

- **Don’t cross your arms or close yourself off**. And don’t hide your hands under the table. Have an open and confident body language.

- **Avoid fidgeting** with your hands or with an object like a pen. Gently fold your hands  
    together if necessary, or rest them on the table. If you take any notes, put the pen down when you finish.
    
    This also applies to clothes:  
    wearing brand new clothes may cause you to shift and fidget, which can  
    be misinterpreted as discomfort with the interview. It might be safer to  
    wear a more reliable, appropriate option instead.
    

- **Subtly mirror what the other person is doing**. For example, if they lean slightly to one side, do the same after a  
    while if it feels natural and comfortable to do so. Also look for when  
    the interviewer is mirroring you, it’s often a sign of the interview  
    going well.

- **Maintain your composure and energy levels** throughout the interview and until you have left the office and are out of sight. Regardless of how you feel the interview is going. You are  
    your own worst critic, and it won’t do you any favours showing  
    disappointment – which may be unwarranted, even.

- At the end of the interview, place your chair back where you found it, and **exit how you entered**: by giving a firm handshake, maintaining eye contact, and thanking the interviewer(s).

### Video Interview

Video interviews are very common these days,  
and often replace in-person interviews. That means you should treat a  
video interview just as you would a full-blown, in-person interview.

Again barring the obvious exceptions, the pointers above in the _Phone Interview_ and _In-Person Interview_ sections also apply to video interviews. However, there are some additional points that you should consider as well:

### Prepare Your Environment

Find a nice, well-lit and quiet spot in your home with a good Wi-Fi signal. Tidy it up so that you'll have a **clutter-free background** and surroundings on camera.

Face the camera in such a way that any household members walking around **won’t be visible on camera** and won’t distract from the conversation.

Place the camera **just above eye level** and angle it ever so slightly downward for a visually pleasing, undistorted view. Make sure to **secure the camera** so it can’t fall over.

Having **soft lighting from the front**  
is ideal. If you can, sit facing a large window or light source. Draw  
your curtains if there is harsh sunlight coming from directly behind you  
as that may silhouette you on camera, making it hard to see you.

Like with a phone interview, you should lay out all the **relevant documents in front of you** for easy access, but you may need to conserve more space. They should be organised and preferably off-camera.

### Prepare Your Computer

Test your setup ahead of time:

- Is your web camera working properly?

- How about the microphone?

- And your headphones or speakers?

- Have you set the necessary permissions in your web browser to be able to use the camera and the microphone?

- Have you set the necessary permissions in your web browser to be able to share your screen during the video call?

- Have you installed the necessary software to access the video call?

- Have you set up any necessary accounts to access the video call?

- Do you have the password (if applicable) to access the video call?

When it comes time to look at your showreel, sometimes **you may be asked to share your screen**.  
It can be easier if you have the controls when playing through your  
showreel, so that you can start and stop it at your own pace, and  
comment on specific things for each shot.

**Turn off the audio**  
when playing through your showreel. You’ll be scrubbing back and forth  
and playing certain areas over again, all the while talking about your  
shots. The music on your showreel will only be a distraction.

If you do share your screen during the interview, preferably **only share the browser tab**  
which has your showreel open in it. If you have to share your whole  
screen, make sure that no unrelated websites are open in other tabs.  
Have a look at any visible bookmarks, too, and hide anything that you  
want to keep private.

Next, **clean up your desktop**.  
A cluttered desktop makes you seem unorganised, and an inappropriate  
wallpaper is, well, inappropriate. Make sure your desktop looks  
professional.

Make sure to **be on time**, and on camera one or two minutes ahead of time. That way, the recruiter will see that you're on the call and ready to go.

# After The Interview

**Send a thank you email**  
to the interviewer(s) shortly after the interview. Preferably within  
1-2 hours, but if that’s not possible, at least on the same day. Thank  
them for taking the time to interview you, and if you can, mention  
specific things from the conversation that stood out as interesting to  
you.

Depending on the company’s hiring process,  
they may make an offer as early as within 24 hours. It may take a few  
days, though, but **normally no longer than a week**.

By having asked at the end of the interview what the next steps are, you can **manage your expectations** better regarding when you will find out if you have been successful in your application.

However, if you don't hear back, **follow up after one week**. (Obviously make sure the period which the recruiter said they would get back to you within has passed, if longer than a week).

Send an email politely asking how the hiring  
process is going and if they have made a decision yet. This shows that  
you are still interested in the role.

Finally, apply for other jobs while you wait for an offer. Don't focus all your energy into one company.

Good luck! 😊

  

# Why You Should Level Up Your Negotiating Skills

Contrary to what you may think, learning the art of negotiation is a valuable skill that can be **useful in all areas of life** – not just in hostage situations or corporate mergers.

When it comes to salary negotiations, knowing how to negotiate well can **potentially earn you thousands of pounds more** than what you would have gotten otherwise.

It does take a bit of time and practice to get it right but **the long-term rewards will far outsize the effort** you put into it. I can personally attest that it’s well worth it.

# Research The Market

The single most important thing to do is to **find out what your market value is**.

By knowing what you are actually worth as a  
compositor at your level, you’ll build the confidence to both ask for a  
fair salary, and to reject low-ball offers.

It’s crucial to do your homework and to **come well prepared into the negotiation**.  
Look up every source you can find on the market rates in your area, and  
make an informed decision of how much you can reasonably ask for.

Below are reputable resources for determining your market rate:

- [Bectu’s Animation and VFX Ratecard](https://bectu.org.uk/get-involved-in-the-union/ratecards/)

- [YunoJuno Freelancer Rates Report](https://www.yunojuno.com/freelancer-rates-report)

- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/)

- [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Compositor/Salary)

- [Salary](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/hiring/compositor-salary)

- [Comparably](https://www.comparably.com/salaries/salaries-for-compositor)

- Asking your colleagues or friends working in the VFX industry

That last point above is probably the most underrated one. (See the _Salary Transparency_ section further down below). By **speaking candidly with friends in the industry** I have learned so much about my own market value, and have been able to significantly increase my salary through the years.

# Adjust Your Rates

Keep in mind **there is a difference between salaried and freelance rates**. The latter will be higher because you also have to account for things like:

- Taxes, pension, and student loans

- Holidays

- Sick days

- Downtime between projects

- Hardware equipment costs, such as a workstation, monitor, Wacom tablet, web camera, etc.

- Software costs or subscriptions such as a Nuke licence, plug-ins, etc.

- Potential office rent and utilities (e.g. WeWork or similar solutions)

- Travel expenses

- Insurance costs

- Legal and accounting fees

- Training and professional education

- Professional membership fees

- Stationary or materials

- Phone and broadband bills

- Website and advertising costs

- Any other benefits which would be included in a salaried position

- Non-billable hours (which can quickly amount to **30-40% of the total hours** worked!), such as:

- Administrative work

- Replying to emails

- Prospecting and finding new clients

- Marketing and advertising

- Invoicing

- Any day-to-day work which will take up time that is not directly billable

Make sure that you calculate what those extras amount to, and **adjust your rates accordingly**.

💡 Also consider the factor of **supply and demand**.  
As a freelancer you are supplying an important skill at an optimal  
time, which you can charge a premium for. There is a reason the client  
is hiring you, whether it is a time constraint, staff shortage, or skill  
shortage within the company.

A rough guideline is to **add another 40% to the gross salary** you would want to receive in a full-time role, to cover all of the extra freelancing costs.

When you have a salary in mind, divide it by  
the number of working days per year (Google for example ‘working days  
[current year] [your country]’ to find that number), and then you will  
have your daily freelance rate. **Round it up for good measure**.

# Shoot Your Shot

At the end of the job interview or in a follow-up email, you will usually be asked what salary you are looking for.

Some will say that whoever says a number first has "lost" the negotiation.

I don’t think that’s necessarily true. If you have done your research beforehand and come well prepared, then **there’s no disadvantage to going first**. You will be able to set the initial conditions in your favour, and can back up your numbers with hard data.

And so, if you are asked what your salary  
expectations are, don’t awkwardly try to evade the question or redirect  
it back at them. Instead, **anchor down a narrow range**.

As an example, looking at Bectu’s Animation  
and VFX Ratecard for 2022, a mid-level compositor on a PAYE rate can  
expect a salary of between £46,000 and £65,000 per year in the UK.

Let’s say that you are a little bit more  
advanced than a low-mid, but not a high-mid yet – somewhere near the  
middle. You could then reasonably expect a salary of around  
£50,000-£55,000.

That’s the range you want to anchor in your response.

💡 As a rough guideline, take around 10% of the salary that you are  
aiming for, and make that the delta of the salary range. So for a salary  
of £50,000, the delta would be £5,000, giving you a range of  
£50,000-£55,000. (Just don’t let your range get too broad; cap it  
somewhere between £5k and £10k).

Using the full £46,000-£65,000 range (£19k  
delta) is too broad. You effectively give them permission to offer a  
salary from the lower end of the range. So keep your range narrow, and **set the lowest number to a value you would still gladly accept**.

You can potentially also **use odd numbers to appear even more specific**.  
If you were to ask for £53,000-57,000 it sounds like you did your  
research. – As you should have! Just be prepared to back up your salary  
expectations in case they get challenged.

Try to **find the balance**  
between modesty and cockiness. If you ask for a low salary, you let  
them take advantage of you (and they usually will – why wouldn’t they  
accept to pay less?). On the other hand, if you ask for a number way  
above what they are prepared to pay, you risk them backing away from the  
deal.

By doing your research properly ahead of time, you’ll be able to find the sweet spot and **offer a win-win scenario**. Remember, a truly successful negotiation is when both parties leave feeling they got a fair deal.

The tendency is often for jobseekers to be more modest than cocky, though.

Don’t be afraid to **ask for what your market value dictates**,  
even if it seems high compared to your current salary. Earlier in my  
career, I was able to secure an almost 50% pay rise when I realised I  
was being underpaid and went to a competitor.

Your salary request should be based on the market and your qualifications, and nothing more. **Avoid bringing up anything else in the negotiation**, such as your financial situation or your current/previous salary.

It’s none of their business, neither is it  
their responsibility, if you are in debt or underpaid. Revealing too  
much information is more likely to backfire than anything else. Give  
them your range, back it up with your research if contested, and then  
stop talking until they have responded to your request.

**Don’t accept a bad deal just to get the job**. Keep in mind that _an_ offer may not necessarily be better than _no_  
offer. Ask yourself beforehand what you are willing to give up, and  
what you are not. Walking away from a bad deal should always be an  
option. Especially if it feels rushed and not quite right.

On the other end of the spectrum, **don’t over-negotiate**.  
Stop negotiating if and when you reach the high end of your market  
value. As mentioned above, if you push too far, the other party may walk  
away from the deal.

**Don’t bluff**.  
Overleveraging yourself will likely come back to bite you. Just be  
honest, direct (without being rude), and ethical during the negotiation.  
Be a trustworthy person.

**Don’t underestimate the importance of likeability**. They will only fight for you if they like you. And so you should:

- Be polite and non-confrontational

- Bring positive vibes and a calm demeanour to the negotiation

- Ask for what you deserve without being greedy

- Point out any deficiencies in the offer without seeming petty

- Be persistent without being a nuisance

- Avoid haggling over every little thing

- Assume good intent behind the actions of the other person

- Understand their constraints (e.g. salary caps)

- Tell the truth and be ethical

**Don’t assume that anything is non-negotiable**. If they can't quite meet your salary expectations, ask if they can offer more holidays or other benefits to compensate.

**Let them know if you have received other offers**  
– but be clear that they can still get you. If you just list off a  
bunch of other offers, they may start to think that jumping through all  
the hoops won't be worth it. Explain specifically why, or under what  
conditions, you would be happy to forgo the other offers.

Lastly, **don’t take anything personally**.  
It’s just business. If you feel attacked and defensive in a situation,  
reframe it into a moment of curiosity where you can gain valuable  
feedback.

💡 If the situation feels a bit tense and uncomfortable, keep in mind  
that the other person may very well be under pressure from their  
superior to hit certain targets, or could simply be having a bad day.  
You haven’t necessarily done anything wrong.

# Move Or Stay

Moving between companies is generally the most effective way of increasing your salary.

You can **ask for a bigger jump in pay** each time you move to a different company, than what you would get in your annual pay rise within the same company.

There is more to a job than just the money, though. **Consider the whole package** when making your decision about whether or not to accept an offer.

Evaluate the following:

- Salary

- Amount of holidays

- Any benefits or perks

- Overtime policy and extra pay

- Contract length

- Responsibilities

- Flexibility (e.g. with working hours, or remote working)

- Office location and commute

- Types and standard of projects

- Company culture and reputation

- Options for career progression

- Day-to-day enjoyment (e.g. any good friends of yours working there?)

- Meeting new people

- Benefits of learning to use a different pipeline, tools, and workflows; expanding your knowledge

Should you decide to stay at a company, the best ways to increase your salary are to **keep adding value** and to **build an excellent reputation**.

By demonstrably becoming better and better, you become more and more likely to be given valuable opportunities and to **get promoted**.

See [Part 8: Excel In Your New Role](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-8-excel-in-your-new-role/) for tips on how to do exactly that.

# Counteroffers

When you get offers from other companies, **let your employer know**.

Contact your manager, HR, or someone who deals with salaries in your company, either in person or via email, and **clearly lay out the offer you have received**.  
They might come back with a counteroffer. If you have followed the  
steps above and become a truly valuable employee, the company is more  
likely to fight to make you stay.

💡 Generally, **it's more expensive to hire someone new**  
than it is to give an existing employee a raise. With a new hire, it  
takes time to integrate them into the company, train them on the  
pipeline, etc. And so if you are a great employee, they will want to  
keep you.

How you go about negotiating counteroffers is important. You certainly want to **avoid burning any bridges**, come off as greedy and difficult, or sour the relationships.

Instead, you want to **be diplomatic**; relay information between the parties, and politely ask if they can match or exceed each others’ offers.

Another important thing is to **avoid giving false hope**.  
If the other offer is great and you would require multiple things in  
order to stay (higher salary, more holidays, and higher overtime pay,  
for example), list them all at the same time.

If you only list one or two things at first,  
they may wrongly think that by offering those they will succeed in  
keeping you. Which means they will be disappointed, and it puts you in a  
bad light when you ask for more.

Think of your own interests but still **be respectful to all parties in the negotiation**.

Don’t go back and forth too many times. Instead, **make the negotiation efficient**. Dragging it out over minor increases will lead to frustration. So avoid negotiating for the sake of negotiating.

Don’t ghost anyone, rather, **sincerely thank the losing party**  
for their time and efforts, and let them know your door is open for  
future opportunities. And, of course, show genuine appreciation to the  
ones who gave you the winning offer.

💡 **Respect any notice period** if you decide to leave for another company.

Note that **you can also be the person initiating a counteroffer**.  
If you receive an offer from a company which is not up to your  
standards, you can politely ask them to increase it. Your options aren’t  
only to accept or decline. Keep in mind that you are much more likely  
to get a 10% increase than a 50% increase, though, so counter  
accordingly.

# Annual Salary Review

The annual salary review is also an opportunity for negotiation.

Depending on the company, each year you may  
be offered a percentage increase or a flat increase in salary. However,  
if you don’t feel like the pay rise is in line with your performance, **you don’t necessarily have to accept the first offer**.

Throughout the year, **keep track of everything that relates to your performance**:

- **Everything that you have contributed** to the projects and to the company, such as shots, tools, training other colleagues, wiki contributions, etc.

- **All the overtime** you have done, and the extra efforts you have put in.

- Every situation **when you went above and beyond**. Did you 'save the day' at some point?

- **What you have learned**, especially on your own time, and specifically how you have improved. Describe the increase in value you now bring.

Armed with all of this information you are in a much better position to negotiate because you can directly **show them what you are bringing to the table**.

💡 Remember to take the current rate of inflation into account. If  
inflation for example is at 7% and you only get a 5% pay rise, then **you effectively take a pay cut**.

The same rules as previously described  
regarding salary negotiations and counteroffers also apply to your  
annual salary review. Negotiate in a firm and fair manner.

# Double Check The Offer

When you get an offer in writing, **double check every detail**.

On three separate occasions, I have received  
offers with a lower number than what we agreed upon in the negotiation.  
They may all have been typos and innocent mistakes, but it has happened  
to other friends of mine in the VFX industry as well, so it appears  
these mistakes do happen occasionally.

Be mindful if it happens to you. Don't  
blindly or cowardly agree to the terms if they are incorrect. Politely  
call the contact person out on it and let them know what was agreed  
upon. This could be in the form of a polite reply to the email saying  
something like:

_Hi [Contact person’s name],_  
  
_In the interview I believe we agreed upon a salary of £[amount], could you please confirm?_  
  
_Kind regards,_  
_[Your name]._

# Salary Transparency

Many companies will have a section in their  
contract which states that you should not disclose or discuss your  
salary with your coworkers.

This **secrecy benefits the employer**  
because they can pay people with the same qualifications and experience  
differently at their discretion. If one person is worse at negotiating  
their salary than another, they will often be paid less. It is in the  
company's (short term) financial interest to do so.

That might seem unfair to employees, and  
frankly, it often is. Without transparent employee salaries it will  
continue to be unfair, and it will be up to you to practise your salary  
negotiation skills to get a fair wage.

The other side of the coin is that **transparency can have consequences**,  
and it might not tell the full story, either. Salary transparency can  
initially cause dissatisfaction amongst employees. A person of the same  
seniority as a peer might feel entitled to an equal (i.e. higher) salary  
when comparing their pay to their peers'. To a degree this is valid,  
but it also requires some people to swallow a few hard truths.

Two people, both with let’s say five years of experience, can have **wildly different skill levels**.  
One person can add a disproportionate amount of value to the company  
compared to the other. They may perform significantly better and  
contribute much more to projects and to the work environment, and thus  
be worth more to the employer.

If the better employee brings double the  
value to the company and is rewarded for that with a higher salary, the  
other (who might be unaware of the difference in performance) could feel  
left behind – when only comparing the salaries versus the years of  
experience.

Still, **salary transparency benefits employees** who should, with every right, be paid more than they are, but who perhaps were not as effective when negotiating their salary.

Adam Conover [sums it up nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xH7eGFuSYI).

💡 Check the relevant laws in your country first, before discussing your salary.

  

# Why You Should Excel Right Away

When you take on a new role, you should start providing value as soon as possible so that **you stop being a liability** to the company.

They have taken a (calculated) risk in hiring  
you, and you want to make it immediately clear that they have made the  
right decision.

In addition to reassuring them, excelling in your new role will help you to:

- **Increase your surface area for attracting luck**. When people learn that you are a person who gets things done, you will be given more opportunities.

- **Make your colleagues enjoy working with you**. If you make someone else’s life easier, they will like working with you _and_ be happy to reciprocate, which leads to good vibes all around.

- **Get people to vouch for you**. Later down the line, you are more likely to get a glowing recommendation.

Positioning yourself as an excellent compositor is a **win-win scenario**. The speed and quality of your output will benefit the employer, and the habits and reputation you build will benefit you.

# How To Excel Quickly

Let's break down how you can exceed expectations and **contribute the most value possible** in your new role.

Below are 32 different ways – and the more of them you follow, the better your chances are of excelling.

Let’s dive in.

### 1. Don’t Be Late

Showing up late to work (especially in the first week) will leave a bad impression.

Make sure that you are _at least_ on time every day, and even try to come in a little bit before. By showing up early, you will:

1. Demonstrate strong motivation and commitment.

1. Have more time to network and build friendships with your coworkers, for example over a morning brew or breakfast.

1. Get to know your new surroundings in the workplace.

1. Already be set up and ready to go when the workday begins.

1. [Longterm] Get a head start on the day  
    and tackle high-priority tasks before others arrive (i.e. when it’s less hectic and there are fewer distractions).

Five significant benefits from a single good habit. That's a pretty good return, if you ask me.

### 2. Pay Attention During Induction

The induction period is where you’ll encounter the first tasks and training related to your new role and to the specific studio.

Depending on the company, the induction  
process can range from a short and casual introductory chat to a formal,  
multi-day training procedure.

Pay attention during induction so that you  
can hit the ground running in your new role. The quicker you get up to  
speed, the faster you can start contributing to projects and bringing  
value to the company.

During induction, you should:

- Get a clear understanding of your job duties and responsibilities.

- Meet your coworkers and start building relationships with them.

- Learn about the company’s culture and values, and see how you fit into the bigger picture.

- Familiarise yourself with the company’s policies and procedures.

- Get up to speed with the systems, tools, and pipeline.

Make sure to listen carefully during  
induction and take detailed notes. That way, you can avoid having to go  
back later on to ask about things that were already covered.

Respect the inductor's and your other  
colleagues' efforts, and show that you are not there to waste anyone's  
time. By swinging into action early on, you will stand out as an  
impressive new hire.

### 3. Be An Information Sponge

After the induction, continue on with the same mentality and soak up as much information as you can in the first few weeks.

There will be a lot of new things to learn.  
Take notes for everything and review your notes regularly to ensure you  
remember it all.

Ask again if something is unclear. If you  
feel that's awkward, remember it's much better to look foolish once than  
to stay a fool. Ask again if you forget something, also. But make sure  
that you don't need to ask a third time - lock the information into your  
memory _and_ your notepad for future reference.

By taking on board all the new information you receive, you’ll be better equipped to tackle your tasks. And, by _showing_  
that you understand and act on the information, you create a positive  
impression and establish yourself as a valuable team member.

### 4. Maintain Good Hygiene And Cleanliness

This should be obvious, but it needs to be said.

Be pleasant to sit next to in the office; it  
will help make people enjoy working with you. Shower regularly, use  
deodorant, wear clean clothes, brush your teeth, and use a modest amount  
of perfume/cologne. (Too much can be obnoxious – a scent should be  
discovered, not announced).

💡 If you can smell your own sweat a little bit, others can smell it a lot.

And speaking of smells, avoid microwaving  
fish or other strongly smelling foods in the office. It's in everyone's  
best interest to respect the sanctity of the communal areas.

Make sure to clean up after yourself in the  
office kitchen. Clogging the sink with soggy cereal leftovers sets a bad  
example for office behaviour and leads to frustration.

This also applies to your desk; avoid leaving  
crusty plates with old food or stained mugs all over it. Keep it clean  
and tidy, making sure your items do not spill over onto neighbouring  
desks.

Sanitise your desk and peripherals every once in a while. Your keyboard may be home to [three times more bacteria than a toilet seat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/reehines/2015/08/11/5-gadgets-with-more-germs-than-your-toilet-seat/?sh=7be7f4f212fe).

Like with the office kitchen, avoid making a  
mess in the bathrooms. At a former company I worked at, the stalls in  
the men's room would regularly look like a caveman had been trying to  
use them.

If the toilet doesn't flush, close the lid,  
put the toilet brush and holder on top of it as a warning to others, and  
contact building facilities to come and sort it out. Don't just leave  
the mess to be discovered by the next person.

[Wash your hands often and properly](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), especially after toilet visits. Lack of, or insufficient, handwashing is one of the main reasons [the Norovirus spreads](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/transmission.html), and it also [spreads the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm).

Avoid going into the office when you're  
feeling unwell. Work from home if you feel fine to work, rather than  
spreading sickness to your colleagues. Covid-19 should have taught us  
all a lesson by this point.

Apologies for going off on a little bit of a rant, but these simple actions have such a large impact on the whole team.

### 5. Always Be Learning

Remain a curious student and regularly seek to learn new skills and techniques.

Building up and expanding your own personal  
library of knowledge means you’ll have more to offer as a compositor. By  
continually learning, you stay up-to-date on the latest developments  
and trends, and remain competitive in the field of VFX. And, learning  
new things will improve your problem-solving and critical thinking  
skills.

Study and research as much as you can about  
Nuke and compositing. Even things that don't directly impact what you're  
currently working on. I can't count how many times a technique or a  
trick from a random but interesting tutorial I found years and years ago  
saved the day on a shot.

Learning more will also help you move up the  
ranks faster. If you can consistently show that you perform above your  
level, you'll have more leverage when looking for a promotion or a new  
role.

### 6. Increase Your Productivity

I have a simple formula for being productive. I call it The Three Musketeers of Productivity:

Productivity = Effectiveness x Efficiency x Timing

In other words, to be productive, you rely on:

1. **Effectiveness**: Doing the right things.

1. **Efficiency**: Doing things the right way.

1. **Timing**: Doing things at the right time.

You have to perform well on all three points,  
as lacking in any one of them will make your productivity suffer. Each  
of them is a multiplier, which means they all have a significant  
individual impact on the whole.

Doing the wrong thing, and/or doing things  
the wrong way, and/or doing things at the wrong time, will each and all  
end up with the same result: you’ll likely see significant delays or a  
failure to deliver.

So, unite your musketeers; One for all, all  
for one! Build up your knowledge of compositing, improve your  
implementation of this knowledge, and hone your ability to prioritise  
when to implement what.

This is where improving your workflows comes into play.

Since Nuke is a node based compositing  
system, there are a huge number of different ways to achieve the same  
thing. This freedom can be deceiving, because the fact is that **some ways are objectively better than others**. The order in which you perform your operations will make a significant difference to your productivity.

As a simple example, let’s say that you have  
applied a transformation to your image, for instance a corner pin on an  
element plate. Then, you need to roto something in the plate, for  
example a person. Doing the roto after the corner pinning would work,  
but if you would need to change the corner pin at some point later on,  
the matte would no longer line up and the roto work would be wasted.

Instead, doing the roto on the image _before_  
the corner pin (or any other part which may potentially see a change)  
would be a much more efficient way of working. With experience and  
training, you will learn which orders of operations are better than  
others when compositing.

Keep improving your workflows and you'll noticeably become more productive.

💡 Productivity is a whole topic of itself. Please see [https://www.keheka.com/tag/productivity/](https://www.keheka.com/tag/productivity/) for tips on working more productively.

### 7. Become Known For Great Work

Put effort into producing work that is both creatively and technically outstanding.

If you consistently output shots of a high  
quality, you will both reassure and impress the team, as well as relieve  
stress and pressure from the project.

Some of the best annual review feedback you  
can receive as a compositor is simply, 'I know I can just leave a task  
with them and they will get it done, on time, to a high standard'. It  
means you’re a skilled compositor who is self-driven and rarely causes  
headaches. And that means you’re _treasured_ by supervisors and production.

Producing great work also brings a sense of  
professional fulfilment and pride. It’s personally satisfying to know  
that you are making a positive contribution and doing your best work.

It doesn't mean you should do lots of  
overtime to reach an unrealistic standard of work output. However, it  
does mean you should do the work properly and to the best of your  
ability.

I am genuinely impressed, for example, when I  
can approve the tech check for a shot on the first or second round of  
QC (depending on the difficulty level of the shot, of course). It means  
the compositor really took the time to comb through the shot and to fix  
the technical issues.

It also means they most likely worked in an  
organised way, and took pride in their work before submitting it. They  
didn't just pawn off a version of the shot for me to find the errors and  
report back; they did the hard work themselves.

I respect that.

### 8. Share Your Experience

Share your experience and knowledge with your coworkers.

Always keep your door open, and welcome  
people who come to you for help, advice, or suggestions. It encourages  
open communication and the sharing of ideas and perspectives.

But don't just sit passively and wait for  
inquiries, either – engage with your colleagues and offer your help  
where it's needed. Just by asking 'How's your shot going?', you can end  
up saving someone's day. They might have been banging their head against  
the wall for over an hour trying to solve a problem for which you know a  
simple solution.

Another important point is to specifically  
help out the junior members of the team. Consider offering to mentor  
other compositors, or simply let them know that you are available to  
answer questions they may have. Working from home has made it difficult  
for juniors to level up their skills like they naturally would by being  
in the office, surrounded by more senior compositors.

Sharing your experience helps improve your  
communication skills, as you will need to effectively articulate your  
thoughts and ideas to others. It helps you reflect on what you have  
learned and gained from a particular situation. It also boosts your  
understanding and helps you develop leadership skills when you take the  
initiative and share your knowledge and insights with others.

Sharing your experience benefits the whole team. Knowledge spreads and is a rising tide which lifts all boats.

### 9. Bring Positivity

Always bring a positive, can-do attitude to the workplace.

Avoid dumping your problems onto others. Venting is absolutely fine every once in a while, but not in _every_ conversation. A sour or pessimistic mood can spread to the people around you, but luckily, so can a happy and optimistic one.

Be open, inclusive, and welcoming to others,  
regardless of their background or circumstances. Use a friendly tone  
when you speak, as well as kind non-verbal cues such as smiling and  
making eye contact.

And show interest in others. Demonstrate that  
you care about what they have to say and want to get to know them  
better. Being a good listener and paying attention makes people feel  
heard and appreciated. And you may learn a thing or two!

Lastly, show gratitude. If someone helps you  
out, make sure to thank them and show them you appreciate their time and  
efforts. Sometimes, a simple act of kindness can be the most meaningful  
way to show gratitude. Try to do something nice for them or offer to  
help them in return.

### 10. Help Others Succeed

Part of your duty as a compositor is to help the other members of the team succeed.

In addition to sharing your experience with the other compositors, you can help other departments to be more productive.

For example, you can ask the roto/prep, CG,  
or DMP artist if they could use a slap comp to judge how much coverage  
they will need to include. Or, you can offer to fix something in comp  
that would take longer to do in another department.

You can also let other artists working on the  
shot know how much detail is required, and in which areas of the frame.  
Be specific. That way, they don’t waste time overcomplicating things,  
and you also avoid having to kick back their work.

You can save a lighting artist a lot of time  
by requesting specific render passes. You'll get the freedom to tweak  
the look as much as needed in comp, and it helps avoid them having to  
rework their scene and re-render all the time.

There are many ways you can help others  
succeed. Put yourself in their shoes or simply ask them to find out how  
you can make their lives easier.

And don’t forget both to offer encouragement  
along the way, and to celebrate other people’s achievements. A genuine  
compliment and a pat on the back can brighten someone’s day  
considerably.

### 11. Get An Overview Of The Whole Pipeline

Keep in mind that context matters.

It's easy to get fixated on just the  
compositing side of the work inside your own personal bubble, but  
remember that you rely on the work of several other people from multiple  
disciplines.

In order to collaborate smoothly as a team,  
getting at least a basic understanding of all the other departments and  
the flow of the pipeline is crucial. You'll be better equipped to  
approach problem-solving from a holistic perspective, rather than just  
focusing on your own narrow tasks. Which in turn often leads to more  
creative and effective solutions.

With a better overview, it's easier to judge  
where an issue should be handled, and how each department can best  
support each other.

Help them help you.

There are feedback loops between comp, CG,  
DMP, and roto/prep. As mentioned in the previous point, someone may  
benefit from receiving a slap comp from you to determine the required  
coverage or detail. And often, rendering a bit of extra overscan for the  
CG, or an additional pass, will help solve an issue in comp.

Keeping that back and forth line of  
communication open makes everything more efficient. When everybody knows  
what is expected of them, it becomes much easier to track issues and  
verify changes. The chances of things slipping through the cracks also  
become greatly reduced.

And who knows, you might get a newfound  
appreciation for what the rest of the team is contributing to the  
project, and feel more as a part of one unit.

### 12. Don't Expect Others To Always Get It Right

Working in a multidisciplinary team means that each shot passes through several contact points.

As a compositor, you will regularly be  
importing scans, lighting renders, matte paintings, elements, roto and  
prep work, or even be picking up other compositors' scripts. You'll also  
get production notes from dailies sessions, as well as client notes  
(written by the client side production).

And they may contain mistakes.

You can help spot and address those, _before_ they turn into big problems. But you’ll need an awareness and a mindset shift: don’t blindly expect everything to be correct.

For example, let’s say you are picking up a  
comp script from someone who is off on holiday. They’ve done a repo on  
the comp and there is a black crop at the bottom of the frame. Well, the  
repo must have been intentional, so the black crop is probably cleared,  
right? It could be, but check with the supervisor to make sure. It  
could very well be that it needs fixing.

The same mindset applies every time you start  
compositing a shot. Do you see a boom mic in the corner of the frame,  
but it’s not part of the brief to remove it? Check with the supervisor  
anyway, they may have missed it. Even if they didn’t, it’s better to ask  
than to accidentally leave in a mistake.

When you start working on a shot, gather a bit of information to help compare and verify:

- Look at the editorial reference.

- View the count sheet or ShotGrid information.

- Scrutinise the shot in the context of the sequence. (Building a contact sheet may help).

- Play through each scan, render, or element.

- Ask the relevant artist or supervisor for clarification.

Doing this will help avoid wasting time working on the wrong thing, and eliminate a lot of continuity errors from sequences.

### 13. Keep Communication Running Smoothly

'Communication is key' is a common saying for a reason.

Being able to clearly and effectively  
communicate with others is vital in the VFX industry. It’s important to  
get on the same page for anything related to the work:

- Which direction should you take a shot or sequence in?

- What’s required to make something work?

- What’s the current progress?

- Which issues are you facing?

- Are you waiting for something else before you can start, or continue?

- When is something expected to be delivered?

- Who is responsible for what?

And so on.

There are so many different things that need  
to be communicated clearly on a daily basis. The success of a project  
directly relies on good, unambiguous communication between all of the  
team members.

It's not always easy. We are all somewhere  
along the spectrum between introverted and extroverted. Some people  
might have a harder time freely speaking up during dailies or in team  
briefings. Or they might be afraid of giving honest critique to friends.  
Writing might be their strength, versus having a conversation.

Others might prefer to bounce ideas off each  
other in person, or even struggle with for example dyslexia and  
subsequently written notes and emails.

Playing to your strengths while at the same  
time accommodating others' can be tricky but it is necessary for the  
smooth running of the team. Remember, it’s much better to have a  
slightly awkward conversation than to continue working blindly or  
heading in the wrong direction. The majority of the time, you’ll find  
that everyone is friendly but you have to go first.

Flag any issues early on, and agree on a way  
forward. Discuss with the CG team which passes need to be rendered, or  
what the layer naming should be (if not standardised). Talk with the DMP  
artist about what the plan is for the shot and how you can best support  
each other. Keep production in the loop so that they can help follow up  
and keep track.

💡 Always CC production on emails or in ShotGrid notes where shot  
progression or issues are discussed, so they can stay on top of things.  
Include the show's code name in the email subject as they will often  
have email filters set up for tracking.

Communicate with your lead, supervisor, and/or production:

- About the work that you have finished so they can stay in the loop.

- About any concerns you have with your targets or your progress.

- If you are waiting for something, so they can chase the relevant people.

- To follow up about something previously discussed.

- If you have an idea (or a better idea) for a solution or an approach to a problem.

- To simply bounce ideas.

It's better to over communicate, than to leave out important information.

### 14. Be Proactive

Being proactive is a mindset.

It's about being aware of your surroundings  
and your own situation. It's about consciously looking for opportunities  
to contribute more, improve inefficient workflows, and preemptively  
avoid problems.

In practice, this can happen in many different ways. For example:

- Asking for more work when you run out.

- Flagging potential issues ahead of time  
    with other departments, production, and/or a supervisor. (E.g. you might not meet a deadline because the CG has problems and needs to be  
    re-rendered).

- Setting up scripts ahead of time, ready to go when you get the relevant material.

- Looking for other tasks you can do while waiting on something else.

- Planning ahead and developing ways to make a process more efficient.

- Looking for ways to improve collaboration between artists in different departments.

- Stepping in to help when you see that something might not be done on time.

As a supervisor, when someone's been proactive in the team, it's like discovering a pleasant surprise. It gets noticed.

### 15. Don’t Be Lazy

Never be lazy or take things for granted.

Being lazy strains both your professional and  
personal relationships, because others become frustrated with your lack  
of effort or follow-through.

Unless there is a valid reason, avoid pushing  
your workload onto your coworkers. Take ownership and see your shots  
through until the end.

Being lazy also prevents you from taking  
advantage of opportunities that come your way, as you won’t have the  
energy or motivation to pursue them. Your job performance will suffer,  
which may lead to being passed over for a promotion or not having your  
contract extended.

Remember that VFX is a business, and as a compositor you are providing a service.

To help combat laziness, you can:

- [Set goals](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-1-set-powerful-goals/) to help keep you motivated.

- Break tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks to make the work less daunting or overwhelming.

- Get plenty of sleep at night to feel more energetic.

- Reward yourself when you complete tasks or meet goals, as an incentive to do more.

- Take regular breaks to avoid overworking yourself.

- Eat better, healthier food to maintain your energy levels.

- Find ways to make the work more interesting or enjoyable.

- Change your environment. If you’ve been  
    working from home, go into the office for some time, and vice versa. A  
    change of scenery can often help.

- Remove distractions, such as turning off the notifications on your phone.

- Practise discipline. Motivation will not always be there for you, and that’s when you fall back on discipline.

There really aren’t any good excuses for  
being lazy. It’s just a waste of potential. By avoiding being lazy you  
will rocket past those who are.

### 16. Learn From Your Mistakes

Learning from your mistakes is an essential part of personal and professional growth.

By analysing what went wrong and thinking  
about what you could have done differently, you can identify areas where  
you need to make changes. Look for the root cause of the issue, though,  
and not the surface-level error. Band-aid fixes tend to cause more  
problems than they solve. Instead, identify patterns or underlying  
issues that you can address to prevent similar mistakes from happening  
in the future.

Remember that making a mistake presents an  
opportunity for learning. Other people can often provide valuable  
perspectives on your mistakes. Seek out feedback to help you gain a  
deeper understanding of what went wrong and how you can improve.

Learning from your mistakes also builds  
confidence and resilience. You’ll be able to better cope with setbacks  
and failures. Instead of getting discouraged or giving up, you will be  
more likely to persevere and find ways to overcome the obstacles.

You also validate those who helped you in the  
first place. If someone took the time and effort to show you how to fix  
or avoid a problem, it’s almost an insult to them to keep repeating the  
same mistake. Instead, show that you have learned, and are worth being  
invested in further.

Here are some good practices for solving common mistakes when compositing:

[Troubleshooting Your Nuke Script](https://www.keheka.com/troubleshooting-your-nuke-script/).

### 17. Demonstrate Your Capabilities

Show that you can already do work that is above your pay grade.

If you’re a strong junior compositor, ask to  
take on mid-level shots. If you want to step into a Lead role, make it  
easy for supervisors and management to visualise you as a Lead.

Continuously practise and improve your  
compositing skills, your networking skills, your leadership skills, etc.  
to meet or exceed the required qualifications for the next role. Blow  
them away with the quality _and_ quantity of your work, and show them that you are progressing well beyond your current role requirements.

Become a safe bet for a promotion.

If you:

- Build and share useful tools.

- Share your ideas, for example when discussing the direction to take shots in.

- Provide helpful suggestions for improvements to the pipeline.

- Flag potential problems early on and offer solutions.

- Contribute more, and higher quality, work to the show and to the company than other people.

- Prove to be a productive, useful team member.

- Show empathy and listen to others.

Then, people will turn to you when they need help. You become a valuable asset to the team and to the company.

You’ll be given more opportunities which occasionally will lead to lucky breaks.

### 18. Be Realistic Regarding Targets

It’s better to underpromise and overdeliver, than the other way around.

When judging how long a task is going to take, err on the side of caution and add _at least_ an extra 30% or more to your estimate. Very often, things will take longer to finish than you initially think.

There could be unforeseen issues which cause delays, for example:

- The task turns out to be more difficult than anticipated.

- The render farm gets slammed by other projects, and there is a queue.

- Others don't deliver vital material on time, for example roto/prep, CG renders, or matte paintings.

- Nuke keeps crashing for some reason and you have to troubleshoot.

- You spot something else which needs to be done on the shot.

- You get additional client notes.

- The server goes down or you lose access to your workstation for a period of time.

- Or, some other unexpected problem needs to be fixed.

When we give estimates, we tend to visualise  
ideal conditions. While it's great to be optimistic, make sure that  
you're also staying realistic. Remember to add a generous buffer to  
account for things taking longer than expected.

By underpromising, you set yourself up for success.

Let's say that you think a task will take two  
hours to complete. When asked, you could for example give an estimate  
of half a day.

If everything goes well and it ends up only  
taking two hours like you thought, that's fantastic – you can now  
deliver early. The supervisor/production/client will be thrilled.

If something goes wrong and it actually takes  
three or four hours, that's not a problem – you have already managed  
their expectations to account for that, and they will be happy that you  
deliver on time.

By being realistic regarding targets and not  
underestimating the time something will take, everyone will benefit.  
Production can plan ahead properly, client expectations can be managed  
well, and you will have less stress on delivery days.

Everyone's happy.

### 19. Enter The Zone

Getting into the zone or a flow state can be magical.

Hours can feel like minutes as you fly from  
one task or objective to another in this hyper productive state. Without  
interruptions you can get a surprising amount of work done, let your  
creativity loose, and achieve more than you can imagine. It's all about  
focus.

“Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work in hand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus.“

- Alexander Graham Bell

Here are some tips for getting into the zone:

- **Set clear goals or objectives** for what you want to achieve out of the session. E.g. ‘In the next 30  
    minutes I will key/rotoscope the midground people in this green screen  
    element’.

- **Eliminate distractions and interruptions**. Allow yourself to be fully immersed in the activity. Social media,  
    Whatsapp, emails – they can all wait for a little bit while you work on  
    your task. Put your phone away and close unnecessary browser tabs. Go to the bathroom. Make a cup of tea or coffee, or bring a small snack. Tidy up your desk and get rid of distracting clutter. Make sure you have the necessary tools and resources on hand before you begin your session.

- **Get the level of challenge right**. A junior working on a senior level shot will constantly hit roadblocks  
    and get frustrated, need to ask for help, and break the flow state. Try  
    to work on things that are challenging, but not too difficult or too  
    easy.

- **Create the right ambience for you**. The environment around you affects your flow state. Some people like to listen to music while they work, others prefer silence. You may want to keep the room dimly lit when fine tuning colour grades, or flood it  
    with natural light to stay energised when doing less colour sensitive  
    work. Sounds, smells, lighting, temperature, and clothing – adjust them  
    to a level that is comfortable to you.

- **Use ‘flow triggers’**. You may find that certain habits or specific routines will help you  
    enter the flow state more easily. Those are your flow triggers. It can  
    be as simple as a stretching routine before starting work, or as  
    elaborate as a complex ritual involving specific music and lighting.  
    Experiment with different flow triggers and see what works best for you.

- **Focus solely on a single task**. You can [leapfrog between tasks](https://www.keheka.com/the-leapfrog-technique/) if you want to, but concentrate fully on each task separately. Remember the quote above by Alexander Graham Bell.

If you can reliably get into the flow state, your productivity will skyrocket.

### 20. Don’t Be Late, Part 2

Building further on the first point, don’t be late to meetings and events.

Whether it's for dailies, briefings, or  
(especially) client meetings, the act of being on time – or better yet,  
arriving a little bit before:

- Shows respect to the other participants. It demonstrates that you value their time and are willing to work with  
    them to meet deadlines and achieve goals.

- Allows others to plan their schedules and not waste time waiting for you.

- Helps you build a reputation of being reliable and responsible.

- Makes you feel less rushed and stressed, as you’ll have more time to prepare.

- Again, gives you more time to network  
    and make connections. Chit chatting about interesting news or sharing a  
    laugh in the few minutes before a meeting starts will brighten up  
    everyone’s day and forge deeper social bonds.

My primary school teacher used to say **“Precisely on time is too late”**. And while he was a notoriously strict man, I think there is a gentle truth to that.

### 21. Participate In Dailies

Dailies sessions are there to help regularly oversee and guide the progress of the work on a project.

They’re also a place to share ideas, flag  
potential issues, and ask for clarification. Dailies are not meant to be  
a one way street, so make sure that you participate and contribute.

When your shot comes up in dailies, **tell the supervisor what you have changed**  
since the last time they saw a version. It's very helpful to remind  
them, as they will sometimes be reviewing dozens of shots per session  
and can easily lose track.

Also let them know if there is **a note you haven't addressed yet**, and/or if there is something you are still planning to do with the shot. Keep it brief.

When it's your turn in dailies, personally **take your own notes**.  
The members of production often don't have in-depth knowledge of  
compositing, and so notes from the supervisor can be misheard or  
misunderstood. Which means, **production notes can be misleading**, and you shouldn't solely rely on them.

💡 Always bring a notepad, and your phone as a light so you can see it in the dark screening room.

When there is a lot to review in a dailies  
session, they will often stagger the entry for artists so that everyone  
doesn't have to sit through a full hour or longer. And so, especially if  
you're working from home, **make sure that you are reachable** during dailies.

Check your emails or chats regularly and be ready to enter dailies at a moment's notice.

Make sure that you **submit your work regularly**  
to dailies for feedback. It's much better for the supervisor to guide  
the direction of a shot through a few Work In Progress versions, than to  
only get to see one 'finished' version and potentially having to do a  
full 180 because you went down the wrong path.

Submit a WIP at least every couple of days,  
and when the project gets closer to the deadline it might be useful to  
do it every day (within reason).

If you’re a Lead or someone who also _gives_ notes, it’s a good idea to **view the shots before dailies**  
and prepare your notes. That way, you’ll get to look at the shots on  
two separate occasions, and have a better chance of spotting issues.

Try to **have the previous notes on a shot be read out**,  
before giving new notes in dailies. You’ll then avoid giving  
conflicting notes, and you can check that all the previous notes have  
been addressed.

**Be clear and concise** when  
giving notes. The artist should have a vivid picture in their mind and a  
strong sense of direction by the end of the session.

Don’t forget to **compliment the positive aspects**  
of the shot. Sometimes, a lot of minor changes are needed to get a  
great shot across the finish line. Make it clear that the shot does look  
great, and that the notes are, in fact, minor. That way, the artist  
won’t feel overwhelmed or mistakenly believe their work is terrible.

Lastly, **don't drip feed notes**.  
If you spot ten issues on a shot, there are ten issues with the shot.  
Avoid only giving notes for five of them, and then five more the next  
round of dailies. To the artist, it feels like the goal post is being  
moved.

### 22. Be Open To Receiving Feedback

Constructive criticism is in service to the work.

Whether you receive creative or technical  
notes on your shot, it’s important to always keep in mind that the  
feedback is meant to improve the work. It is **not to be taken personally** or as an attack on your skills or judgement.

Instead of getting defensive and being  
unwilling to accept the feedback, it's much better to stay humble, take  
it all on board, and make the requested changes.

Remember that your supervisor may have a  
decade or more of experience under their belt, and as a result they may  
see issues that you miss. They may also be more aware of the client's  
sensitivities, and know about particular things to focus more on, or to  
avoid.

You might feel a supervisor is being too  
strict with their notes, for example. But they could just be painfully  
aware of the high standards required to avoid kickbacks from the client  
on that project.

However, do speak up and bring to the supervisor's attention if a note:

- **Is confusing or unclear**. For example, if the note says to remove the background person but there are three of them.

- **Conflicts with a previous note**. For example, if a client note said to have the smoke go from left to right, and you get a dailies note saying the opposite.

- **Is wrong**. For example, if you are being asked to remove something which should stay in the shot.

- **Doesn't make sense in the context of the sequence**. For example, if you see a potential continuity issue arising as a result of the note.

- **Is unreasonable**. For example, if a major change is being requested on the day of the deadline.

- **Seems to be meant for another shot**. Sometimes, notes get mixed up between shots, or a sequence receives a  
    blanket note which only applies to some of the shots in it.

- Or, **if you can't see the issue mentioned in the note**. Sometimes, a very small change will be requested, and it can be hard to spot where you're meant to be making the adjustment.

In the cases above, ask for clarification and  
directions for how to proceed. Avoid costly mistakes and  
misunderstandings as early as possible.

Sometimes, even if something is physically  
correct, it can look wrong and we have to cheat it in comp. The client  
might ask us to bend reality to better tell the story.

Do they want to cheat an outrageous defocus?  
That's their prerogative. We could inform them that the lens would not  
physically behave like that, but if they still want us to do it, then it  
is what it is. The story is king and we have to accommodate.

Other times, the client is unfortunately  
going to disagree with the direction we are taking a shot and will want  
to make changes that we don't like. It's ultimately their choice and  
their product, and we are providing a service to them.

Being open to, and accepting of, feedback is a  
good thing. You show willingness to work with someone to achieve their  
vision. And when it boils down to it, that's what you're being paid for  
as a compositor.

### 23. Ask For Help

If you get really stuck on a task, don't  
spend hours hitting your head against a wall or waiting for the next  
dailies session to tell the Lead or Supervisor.

**Reach out to them and ask for help**. Often, a five minute conversation can solve the issue, and save hours going down a dead end.

But let me clarify what I mean by really  
stuck. You will meet bumps in the road all the time. If you make  
concerted efforts to overcome them by attempting every reasonable route,  
then absolutely go ahead and reach out for help.

Don't just go running to the supervisors for  
every little issue that you could have solved yourself with a few  
minutes of research. Google is your friend; your issue has very likely  
been solved by someone else before you.

And when you ask for help, show that you have  
already made an effort trying to solve the problem. Who would you be  
more likely to _want_ to help,  
someone just sitting in a broken down car by the road waiting for you to  
push them, or someone pushing their car along the road all by  
themselves? I, for one, would give the second guy more sympathy.

Be realistic about how much time someone has  
available for helping you, and is willing to spend helping you. The  
supervisors are there to help you composite, not to composite for you.  
Don't just lazily sit back and let them (or a colleague) do the work for  
you. Actively engage, showing that you are interested in learning and  
that you are taking the information on board.

If something is unclear, ask again and write  
it down if necessary. But just like in point 16, once you have learned  
to solve the problem, avoid repeating the same mistake.

### 24. Be Organised

[Organise your work for other people](https://www.keheka.com/organise-your-work-for-other-people/).

If you have ever picked up a Nuke script from  
someone else which looks like a ball of wire, you will know exactly how  
painful it is to work with.

Even the most complex script can be made easy  
to navigate and simple to understand with proper organisation. Spend  
the time tidying up yours to a level where you would be grateful to pick  
it up from someone else.

It's all about getting into good habits, and setting some operational ground rules and boundaries.

For example, having one, clear B-pipe flowing  
straight down in the script, and having all the A-pipes coming in from  
the left hand side. Or, diligently managing the extra channels and the  
bounding box each step of the way through your composite for maximum  
efficiency.

Keep in mind it is easier to keep something  
tidy than it is to make something tidy, so a steady organisational  
effort along the way will do wonders for your Nuke scripts - and your  
sanity!

### 25. Be Trustworthy

Make your word carry weight by keeping promises.

From the simplest things such as returning a  
pen that you borrowed or hanging out with a friend/colleague when you  
said you would, and all the way up to major tasks like delivering a  
critical shot for a trailer deadline.

That means, don't make promises you can't keep. Trust is built over time by **consistently following through** on promises.

💡 Keep in mind, positive and negative actions have a disproportionate  
impact on trust. You could do 20 things right, but doing just 1 wrong  
thing could negate (nearly) all of that progress.

You also have to be open and transparent –  
willing both to share information, and to admit when you don’t know  
something. By showing that you have nothing to hide, and acting with  
integrity even when no one is watching, you become more trustworthy.

Being trustworthy opens up more doors, as  
people will be more likely to entrust you with important tasks and  
responsibilities, and to favour you for promotions.

### 26. Be Brave

Be open to taking chances and to accepting new and potentially scary opportunities.

For example, becoming a Lead on a sequence.  
Yes, there will be new things to learn. No, you may not know everything  
you need to yet. But you also don't have to know everything right away.

So much of the learning takes place on the job. And believe me, a lot of good things happen [when you expand your comfort zone](https://www.keheka.com/the-edge-of-chaos/).

If you have strong skills as a high-mid or senior compositor, you can become a Lead.

Sometimes you have to choose between comfort and progress. And the funny thing is, you become more comfortable _by progressing_.

Choosing progress usually ends up being the best option.

### 27. Go The Extra Mile

There is no traffic jam along the extra mile.

Most people will rarely go above and beyond  
what's expected of them. If they're assigned to one shot for the week,  
they'll usually find a way to fill the week with that one shot. If you  
break that pattern, you'll quickly stand out.

At DNEG, the moment I would run out of work I  
would walk into the production office and ask for more. Every time. I  
would make it my personal mission to not sit idle.

They would give me another shot or two, and I  
would try to complete them as fast as possible (while still delivering  
high quality work), and then go back in and ask for more.

I was perhaps not the only one, but I was at least one of very few who did this.

You get used to maintaining momentum, even a  
high tempo one. One after the other, I was spitting out shots. They  
would get approved and I would quickly move onto the next ones.

For two years in a row, I won the internal DNEG award for compositing the most shots.

And by having composited around twice as many  
shots as the average compositor there, I would have twice as much  
experience, as well as more knowledge of troubleshooting, optimising  
scripts, building useful setups and productive workflows, and so on. It  
snowballed quickly.

All this to say, if you want to grow quickly,  
go the extra mile. After learning all the bread and butter compositing  
skills, go beyond and learn something that not everyone knows how to do.  
When you finish the shots assigned to you, ask for extra work. By  
offering additional value, you become more valuable to the company than  
the average compositor.

And that attracts opportunities.

### 28. Make Downtime Productive

Occasionally, there will be quiet times at work.

It could be in between projects, near the holidays (not always!), or in the periods between jobs.

Spend the downtime setting yourself up for success:

- Read/watch [Nuke tutorials](https://www.keheka.com/tag/nuke/) to learn new techniques.

- Organise and save useful tools or setups that you’ve built or discovered.

- Make shot breakdowns, ready for the awards season and/or your showreel.

- Tidy up your scripts, folders, and toolsets.

- Clean up the server storage by deleting old files that are no longer used and archiving completed projects.

- Update or upgrade software and/or hardware.

- Do research and development.

- Offer to update wikis or write/record tutorials for your company.

- Do life admin you were previously too busy to do.

- [Set goals](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-1-set-powerful-goals/) and make plans.

- Polish up your [CV](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-4-write-an-impressive-cv/) and [showreel](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-3-create-a-spectacular-showreel/).

- Build and expand your [professional network](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-2-build-a-strong-network/).

- Reach out to the friends and family you haven't talked to in a while.

- Join and participate in Nuke groups online, such as the [Foundry Nuke Compositors](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12739433) community on LinkedIn.

- Join compositing newsletters for new  
    tutorials and the latest industry news. For example, Josh Park's  
    compositing newsletter, or [my own compositing newsletter](https://www.keheka.com/how-to-get-hired-as-a-compositor-part-8-excel-in-your-new-role/#/portal/signup).

- Work on personal projects.

- Invest in yourself. Learn a new skill, read a book, or take on a new hobby.

- Even if you have no work to do, treat  
    the day as a normal workday. Get up at a normal time and follow your  
    daily routines. Keeping momentum is key.

- Exercise and get fresh air.

- Reflect on what has worked well and what you can improve.

- Relax and recharge. Taking breaks and  
    engaging in activities that make you relax and destress can help you be  
    more productive when you return to work.

By doing the above you will become a better  
version of yourself with more to offer – and therefore increase your  
worth to an employer.

### 29. Understand The Basics Of Cameras And Light

The majority of compositing work revolves around matching or integrating things into real footage.

To do that well, you have to learn about what  
makes real footage look the way it does. Researching how a camera works  
and how light interacts with the real world is necessary for becoming a  
better compositor.

Look into things like:

- How does a camera's aperture work?

- How does the shutter speed affect the image?

- What is ISO?

- How does depth of field work?

- How do different lenses affect the look of an image?

- How do lens flares behave?

- How will the exterior look when you expose a shot for the interior, and vice versa?

- How do shadows look under different lighting conditions?

- What are common lens artefacts and how do you replicate them?

Looking at real world reference is critical for making something look photorealistic.

Even fantasy looks better when rooted in reality.

### 30. Socialise

When you join a company, you enter into a new tribe.

Show them that you belong. In addition to  
utility, you should offer social value. Get to know people, be open to  
new input, and share your energy.

Becoming part of a tight-knit, cohesive group  
will help give you a sense of identity, belonging, and purpose. By  
making real connections you will boost your self-esteem as friends  
provide a feeling of security and acceptance. Having someone close to  
talk to and share experiences with can make or break your feeling of  
day-to-day enjoyment at work.

A strong social network also opens up new  
opportunities and introductions to other people and activities that you  
might not have otherwise been exposed to.

So make real, continuous efforts to be social and approachable. You can:

- Make a great first impression by being  
    positive and having an open and friendly body language. Be interested  
    in, and pay attention to, what others have to say.

- Take part in social events with your colleagues. It’s great for building friendships.

- Join various social chat channels at work.

- Approach your colleagues with the intention of making friends, don’t just politely pass by everyone.

- Be kind and helpful. Leave your ego  
    behind. It’s a small industry and you’ll likely run into the same people several times over in your career.

- Allow yourself to have fun. Let loose and have a laugh with your coworkers. It’s great for bonding.

- Avoid closing yourself off to other  
    people. For example by wearing headphones at work, or sitting by  
    yourself during lunch. Ask if you can join in.

- When you build a group of friends, make a group chat together on Whatsapp, Discord, or a similar platform. It’s  
    great for banter, but also for support and for sharing work  
    opportunities.

Essentially, help create a work culture that you want to be a part of and that you enjoy.

### 31. Take Care Of Your Mental Health

The Looking Glass reports of [2021](https://filmtvcharity.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LookingGlassReport_2021_Final.pdf) and [2019](https://filmtvcharity.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/The-Looking-Glass-Final-Report-Final.pdf)  
(right click → Save Link As...) both painted a quite sombre picture of  
the dire mental health issues in the visual effects industry.

Poor working conditions and toxic work cultures with excessive overtime and stress, _and_ a lack of support for artists meant that up to 65% had considered leaving in the past year.

I am optimistic that the circumstances will  
change for the better. However, for the time being it very much falls on  
the artists’ shoulders to balance work and life, create a healthy work  
culture, and avoid burnout.

Here are some practical steps to achieve that:

- **Regularly take breaks**. If it helps, set a timer to remind yourself to take them.

- **Set the necessary boundaries**. Overtime is voluntary, don’t feel forced into it if you feel exhausted and need time to rest.

- **Log your time accurately** so that shows can be bid more correctly in the future.

- **Treat working from home like a normal day in the office**. Get dressed, shave, shower, etc. And if you can, set up a separate physical space at home just for working.

- **Seek support**, for example from the mental health first aiders at work, or a mental  
    health professional, if you’re feeling burned out or stretched too thin.

- **Practise stress management techniques**, such as deep breathing or meditation.

- **Engage in other hobbies outside of work**, preferably activities that aren’t in front of a screen.

- **Reach out to friends and family**, and do something completely unrelated to work to recharge your batteries.

- **Remember to have fun** with your colleagues at work. Everything doesn’t always have to be so  
    serious. Spending ten minutes doing something silly like having a paper  
    airplane contest can give you all a much needed break and boost morale  
    in the team.

Below are some helpful resources for improving your mental health:

**Film and TV charity**: [https://filmtvcharity.org.uk/your-support/24-hour-support-line/](https://filmtvcharity.org.uk/your-support/24-hour-support-line/) - Free, 24/7 confidential advice and an online mental health community specifically for our industry.

**Mind**: [https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/helping-someone-else/](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/helping-someone-else/) - Lots of helpful information on not only keeping yourself well, but on giving support to others who may need it too.

**Headspace**: [https://link.chtbl.com/radioheadspace](https://link.chtbl.com/radioheadspace) - the mindfulness app also has daily podcasts ‘to help move away from internal chatter’.

### 32. Take Care Of Your Physical Health

Working in the visual effects industry is often quite sedentary.

We sit in front of a computer most of the  
day, and this carries with it both short and long term health risks  
unless we take the proper precautions:

- **Get an adjustable desk/office chair**. Choose a chair that supports your spinal curves. Adjust the height of  
    your chair so that your feet can rest flat on the floor or on a  
    footrest, and your thighs are parallel to the floor. Adjust the armrests so that your arms can gently rest on them with your shoulders relaxed.

- **Position your monitor in an ergonomic way**. Place it directly in front of you, at least an arm’s length away, with  
    its top edge roughly at your eye level or slightly below. Reflected  
    glare from your monitor can cause eyestrain, so place it facing away  
    from windows or other bright light sources.

- **Use a Wacom tablet (or similar) over a mouse**. It essentially eliminates the Repetitive Strain Injury you get from  
    using a typical mouse. And, once you get used to the eye-hand  
    coordination, it’s far superior for compositing work.

- **Adjust the position of your keyboard and Wacom/mouse**. They should be at or slightly below elbow height, and parallel with  
    your forearms. Avoid having to reach too far, or to reach at an awkward  
    angle.

- **Try using alternative equipment**. If you have access to a standing desk or a treadmill desk, or perhaps a stand-up chair or a yoga ball, they can help to reduce the amount of  
    weight and strain you are putting on your body in any one position.

- **Exercise regularly**. There are [so many benefits to keeping fit](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm), and it’s especially important for us desk workers. Commit to making  
    this healthy habit a part of your life. Like Nike says, just do it.

- **Stay hydrated**. Keep water nearby at all times and drink often.

- **Regularly take breaks**. Every 45 minutes to an hour, take a break away from the monitor. Get up and stretch, and let your eyes rest for a bit.

- **Go for a walk at lunch time**. Get some fresh air and daylight, and get your blood flowing again.

- **Practise the 20-20-20 rule**. For every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, look at something that  
    is 20 feet away for a total of 20 seconds. This reduces eye strain, and  
    can help prevent eye twitching and soreness.

- **Blink**. The [American Academy of Ophthalmology](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/computer-usage) explains that humans normally blink 15 times per minute, but only 5-7  
    times per minute when looking at screens. Blinking is the eye’s way of  
    getting the necessary moisture on its surface, so blinking less causes  
    dryness and irritation.

- **Get enough sleep**. Avoid looking at bright screens [2-3 hours before bedtime](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) and protect yourself from blue light at night.

Save yourself from getting completely preventable injuries.

That's it!
