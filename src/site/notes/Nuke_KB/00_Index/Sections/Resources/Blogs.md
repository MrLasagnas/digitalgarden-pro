Crazy good VFX Technical Director with a looooot of cool gizmos and techniques for Nuke, not everything is sadly available for the public.

## Chris Fryer :

Very cool groups and gizmos with in depth explanation to how they work

## Chris Brejon

An absolute must-read if you work in lighting in Animation or VFX. There’s also great content for compositors in the first few chapters (Color Theory, Colorspaces, ACES, Color Management…) but also in chapter 9 that is all about compositing.

## Tony Lyons :

Some great tips but also a nice help for people switching from AE to Nuke

## Craig Welsch :

Director of Photography and Lighting Supervisor on fully CG animated films like The LEGO Movie and The LEGO Batman movies, both of his entries on these films are a great read even for compositors.
